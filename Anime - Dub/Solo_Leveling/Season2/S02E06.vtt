WEBVTT

00:06.020 --> 00:09.340
An E-Rank Hunter volunteered
to be a porter in an A-Rank dungeon?

00:10.030 --> 00:12.450
He doesn't have multiple lives to waste.

00:13.450 --> 00:14.790
What is he thinking?

00:15.950 --> 00:20.600
Right, I saw him yesterday standing
in front of the Boss Room with a weapon.

00:21.340 --> 00:22.490
He's suspicious.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.170
I'm going in to take a look.

00:25.170 --> 00:25.920
Eh?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.170
Did anything happen inside?

00:28.170 --> 00:30.890
No, it's just a personal business.

00:30.890 --> 00:32.360
There's no need to worry.

00:33.390 --> 00:34.030
Ah.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.030
Sorry.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.940
Could I borrow a weapon?

00:40.300 --> 00:40.980
Eh?

00:41.600 --> 00:42.500
Hmm...

00:44.190 --> 00:45.400
Umm...

00:45.400 --> 00:47.860
Do you have anything besides this?

00:47.860 --> 00:49.700
Like swords or spears?

00:49.700 --> 00:51.880
We don't have that kind of stuff here.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.200
Otherwise,
it's just an iron shovel or crowbar.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.580
Then never mind.

00:55.580 --> 00:56.830
I'll just go in.

00:59.040 --> 00:59.960
Hunter Cha.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.650
Are you sure you'll go in empty-handed?

01:05.820 --> 01:09.800
This is better than going in unarmed.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.790
Then I'm going.

01:41.710 --> 01:45.460
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

03:06.870 --> 03:08.290
So many of them.

03:08.290 --> 03:11.130
If these High Orcs were to go outside...

03:11.130 --> 03:14.880
They could easily raze cities
to the ground.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.840
Especially those four.

03:17.310 --> 03:20.510
Compared with the others,
their aura is completely different.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.110
Our mission is to close the Gate.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.820
We must defeat the Dungeon Boss here.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.810
Are you fearing me?

03:38.280 --> 03:39.950
Humans?

03:43.160 --> 03:44.930
What was that?

03:44.930 --> 03:47.500
It possesses tremendous magic power...

03:47.960 --> 03:52.480
Compared to that thing,
I'm simply a third-rate Mage...

03:53.800 --> 03:57.430
W-Why did you bring us here?

03:57.430 --> 03:59.010
You are the entertainment.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.220
Eh?

04:00.680 --> 04:05.020
I want to kill you off one by one,
torment, and devour you

04:05.020 --> 04:08.190
to entertain my soldiers.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.110
Entertainment?

04:11.650 --> 04:14.490
Our resolve is merely entertainment to it.

04:15.190 --> 04:17.330
To them, our lives...

04:18.070 --> 04:21.780
...are just toys to be discarded?

04:22.240 --> 04:22.990
Oh?

04:23.370 --> 04:26.950
Among those humans,
something strange sneaked in them.

04:26.950 --> 04:30.120
But that's fine.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.920
Everyone, attack!

04:44.930 --> 04:46.640
Hymn of Protection.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.230
What a fool.

04:53.230 --> 04:55.070
Gravitation Magic.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.820
Gravity Acceleration.

05:01.740 --> 05:02.700
Captain!

05:08.660 --> 05:09.720
Kihoon...

05:19.800 --> 05:21.180
Captain Son.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.640
This dungeon belonged to Hunters.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.640
So I'm not supposed to interfere.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.560
But, now the entire
assault team is in danger.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.380
I only ask you one thing.

05:39.190 --> 05:42.910
Can you leave all
the magic beasts here to me?

05:47.450 --> 05:50.580
Please...

05:52.080 --> 05:54.040
How arrogant.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.750
I know your strength.

06:02.090 --> 06:03.400
Indeed.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.300
It's my first time feeling
such a strong presence.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.010
Of course.

06:08.470 --> 06:11.730
It's just a pity that
we are naturally opposed.

06:12.390 --> 06:13.350
Of course.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.520
I will defeat you.

06:26.370 --> 06:26.870
Huh?

06:27.910 --> 06:29.080
Surveillance Department?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.030
What's Surveillance Department doing here?

06:31.030 --> 06:32.460
How would I know?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.960
Someone needs to call the leader over.

06:35.490 --> 06:39.130
Why does he work as a miner here?
And for two consecutive days?

06:39.560 --> 06:40.960
May I ask what brings you here?

06:41.460 --> 06:44.090
Do you know where Hunter Sung Jinwoo is?

06:44.090 --> 06:45.720
Sung?

06:45.720 --> 06:47.430
I knew it!

06:47.430 --> 06:49.510
Something is wrong with that guy!

06:49.510 --> 06:52.980
He stared at me with those scary looks!

06:52.980 --> 06:55.560
I thought he was about to kill me!

06:56.020 --> 06:57.650
So where is Hunter Sung?

06:58.180 --> 06:59.820
He's in the Gate now.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.190
The assault team had no porters,
so he went in to help.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.400
Porter?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.240
Yes.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.110
- A porter after a miner?
- That must be an excuse.

07:07.110 --> 07:08.700
- A porter after a miner?
- That guy must be up to something.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.120
- After becoming an S-Rank Hunter,
- Maybe he's killed

07:10.120 --> 07:11.240
- everything he does
- someone inside.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.830
- is under surveillance.
- He could kill without batting an eye.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.840
- I wish he would be conscious of his actions.
- His gaze is terrifying.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.330
- Um, may I ask...
- He must have killed people before!

07:16.330 --> 07:18.420
Watch the news tomorrow.
You should understand then.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.380
News?!

07:19.830 --> 07:22.300
- But just now, Hunter Cha
- Who cares about the darn news?!

07:22.300 --> 07:24.340
- asked the same question as you.
- Just arrest him!

07:24.740 --> 07:25.700
Hunter Cha?

07:29.210 --> 07:31.930
What was that strange aura?!

07:31.930 --> 07:34.180
I thought I was going to be torn apart.

07:34.180 --> 07:35.560
Do the magic power test again.

07:35.980 --> 07:36.850
Yes!

07:43.440 --> 07:44.650
I need to hurry up.

07:45.110 --> 07:49.990
I don't know how Kihoon's team
managed to kill so many High Orcs.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.140
But if that power just now
came from the Dungeon Boss,

07:55.610 --> 07:57.670
their lives are in danger.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.460
How naive of you to confront my army
with your meager force!

08:04.920 --> 08:07.510
You'll regret underestimating us.

08:09.430 --> 08:11.640
Activate skill: Monarch's Domain.

08:12.340 --> 08:17.560
This is a new job skill I learned after
reaching level 70 in Demon's Castle.

08:18.050 --> 08:22.480
The Shadow Soldiers became stronger
after the battle at Demon's Castle.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.530
What is going on?

08:24.530 --> 08:26.070
Unbelievable...

08:26.070 --> 08:28.950
I can only summon two at most.

08:29.410 --> 08:31.910
Such ominous magic power from a human...

08:34.370 --> 08:35.330
Go.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.040
That move he just did...!

09:06.040 --> 09:08.150
He's just like Vice Master...

09:08.690 --> 09:11.530
Why would someone so strong
come here to work as a porter?

09:13.450 --> 09:15.830
The infantry's strength
is equal to B-Rank Hunters.

09:16.950 --> 09:20.460
Soldiers suffer destruction
four to five times to kill one High Orc.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.010
I must reduce the number of orcs.

09:23.010 --> 09:24.860
Hymn of the Fire Dragon.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.130
Your soldiers are just useless puppets.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.800
Don't be too arrogant.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.640
Say that to yourself.

09:37.350 --> 09:40.020
These soldiers can resurrect infinitely.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.190
Hymn of Protection.

09:42.570 --> 09:43.560
Accelerate.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.240
Gravity Acceleration.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.200
Gravitation Magic.

09:53.910 --> 09:54.910
Accelerate.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.050
Then,

10:00.050 --> 10:02.790
I will keep destroying them
until your magic power runs out

10:03.240 --> 10:05.160
and they are completely eradicated!

10:05.750 --> 10:07.710
Hymn of the Blazing Fire.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.060
Does it intend to keep me at bay

10:19.060 --> 10:22.270
with its formidable magic power
and long-range large-area spells?

10:22.730 --> 10:23.940
Alright.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.980
I am eager to see how long you can last.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.440
The results are out!

10:30.110 --> 10:33.610
The strength of this A-Rank Gate is extremely
close to that of the S-Rank Gate.

10:33.610 --> 10:35.410
Is there a mistake in detection?

10:35.990 --> 10:38.530
Contact the Master of Hunters.

10:38.530 --> 10:42.040
We will get ready to support
the assault team inside.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.350
Y-Yes.

10:44.370 --> 10:49.920
It seems both in number and strength,
my soldiers surpass yours.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.670
Your magic power will run out
sooner or later.

10:55.590 --> 10:57.180
Sooner or later?

10:57.180 --> 10:58.550
What nonsense is that?

11:03.610 --> 11:06.120
The true skill of Necromancer
begins only now.

11:06.980 --> 11:08.190
Arise.

11:08.190 --> 11:09.190
Huh?

11:10.110 --> 11:12.640
You turned my soldiers into the undead...

11:13.650 --> 11:16.610
Before long,
you too will become my shadow.

11:17.110 --> 11:17.950
Of course,

11:19.490 --> 11:20.450
you too.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.520
Could it be that...

11:28.500 --> 11:30.070
He is...

11:31.050 --> 11:31.830
The lord...

11:34.880 --> 11:38.010
In that case, then why am I...

11:38.010 --> 11:39.680
Why am I here?

11:40.300 --> 11:47.440
When I opened my eyes here,
the same command kept echoing in my mind.

11:48.850 --> 11:51.220
Hunt humans.

11:54.070 --> 11:56.650
The reason isn't important.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.620
Just obey the command.

12:01.830 --> 12:02.950
Go.

12:03.290 --> 12:08.830
Eliminate those who stand in the way
and bring their corpses before me.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.960
Equivalent to S-Rank Gate?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.050
If the original detection
results were right,

12:15.050 --> 12:19.180
Hunter Son Kihoon should
have been able to conquer it.

12:19.180 --> 12:20.680
This was completely unexpected.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.890
If the Gate has Dungeon Break,
the Jeju Island incident will happen again.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.350
Fortunately, we still have time.

12:26.750 --> 12:30.230
Mobilize all of
the Hunters' forces to that Gate.

12:32.360 --> 12:36.280
An emergency assembly has been issued
to all A-Rank and above Hunters.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.400
In the worst-case scenario,

12:38.400 --> 12:42.620
maybe we'll have to ask White Tiger Guild
and Fiend Guild for support.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.030
But then...

12:44.510 --> 12:48.000
We can only do our best
to prevent it from worsening.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.280
My generals are gaining the upper hand.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.240
How can this be?

13:25.650 --> 13:27.240
Let's go help them.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.160
Yeah.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.620
Hymn of Agony! Hymn of Blindness!

13:32.000 --> 13:35.460
Audiences aren't allowed on stage.

13:36.340 --> 13:41.730
I will make sure that your arrogant mouth
can never make a sound again.

13:42.130 --> 13:44.850
Hymn of Slumber! Hymn of Lethargy!

13:45.260 --> 13:46.760
Hymn of Blindness!

13:47.600 --> 13:48.770
What?

13:50.390 --> 13:51.390
It's a pity.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.630
Poison and curses have no effect on me.

13:55.230 --> 13:56.950
Hymn of Protection!

13:59.780 --> 14:02.490
I will shatter your annoying shield.

14:23.010 --> 14:24.450
What is going on here?

14:25.260 --> 14:27.240
Did he summon...

14:27.240 --> 14:29.390
...such a large group of soldiers?

14:29.390 --> 14:30.770
Vice Master?

14:32.350 --> 14:33.440
Why are you here?

14:33.950 --> 14:35.000
How is he?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.760
The captain is fine.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.890
That's good.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.840
What's the situation now?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.240
To be honest, we're not too sure either...

14:44.600 --> 14:46.740
You've really done it now!

14:46.740 --> 14:50.370
Hymn of Rage! Hymn of Strengthening!
Hymn of Giants!

14:51.620 --> 14:55.480
I will crush you like a bug!

14:57.840 --> 14:58.990
Heck.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.670
I don't like giants.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.380
I have bad memories of them.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.840
Hymn of the Fire Dragon!

15:24.320 --> 15:29.530
Do you still think you can
go up against me?

15:29.870 --> 15:30.700
Well.

15:39.130 --> 15:42.510
Growing in size only makes you
a more obvious target.

15:43.630 --> 15:48.430
How could a Mage without guards withstand
an assassin-type Hunter's attack?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.850
Hymn of the Blazing Fire!

16:06.320 --> 16:08.400
The dagger couldn't inflict damage, I see.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.280
Then...

16:30.470 --> 16:31.640
Chief Woo?

16:32.430 --> 16:34.640
Is everyone okay?

16:34.640 --> 16:39.000
I felt a strong magic power outside.
So I came in to support the assault team.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.770
But it seems that was unnecessary.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.790
Even the chief of
the Surveillance Department...

16:46.570 --> 16:49.680
He must be a top-tier Fighter.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.610
But he can even use summoning magic.

16:52.780 --> 16:56.200
So this is the power of Hunter Sung...

16:56.760 --> 16:58.550
Who is he?

16:59.080 --> 17:01.300
You know him, right?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.960
Only a little.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.670
I don't know much.

17:09.090 --> 17:11.130
From the moment the Mage lost his guards,

17:11.570 --> 17:13.370
the outcome was already decided.

17:13.850 --> 17:15.680
My body...

17:16.100 --> 17:18.890
My body will not be destroyed!

17:19.350 --> 17:23.170
Absolutely not!

17:38.830 --> 17:41.040
YOU HAVE DEFEATED THE MASTER OF THE DUNGEON

17:41.440 --> 17:45.710
The Boss was defeated, but it didn't
feel right to take all the items.

17:45.710 --> 17:49.460
However, Shadow Extraction should be fine.

17:49.920 --> 17:50.840
Arise.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.180
You are much more docile
after turning into a shadow.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.860
Name?

18:03.440 --> 18:04.940
What was its name again?

18:04.940 --> 18:06.630
Something like Kar...

18:07.230 --> 18:08.650
Sorry, I forgot.

18:08.650 --> 18:09.940
I'll just pick one for you.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.530
Fang.

18:11.530 --> 18:14.240
Your name will be Fang.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.450
Elite Knight Rank?
I've never seen that Rank before.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.790
The shadow extracted from
an A-Rank Dungeon Boss is amazing.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.410
These High Orcs are also a major gain.

18:28.210 --> 18:29.420
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

18:30.260 --> 18:31.420
Chief Woo!

18:31.810 --> 18:34.630
I was so engrossed in extracting
that I didn't even notice him.

18:34.630 --> 18:35.990
Mr. Sung.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.730
Mr. Porter, what happened just now?

18:39.370 --> 18:40.350
Umm...

18:40.350 --> 18:41.850
How should I explain this?

18:43.440 --> 18:45.690
We are Hunter Association Surveillance Team.

18:45.690 --> 18:48.520
Hunter Sung Jinwoo,
who is in front of you,

18:48.520 --> 18:50.570
is our Association's top secret.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.410
We ask everyone present
to keep today's events confidential.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.700
We will escort you out.

18:57.700 --> 19:01.260
This is the best way to avoid trouble.

19:02.840 --> 19:09.210
Hunter Sung has displayed the power of
an S-Rank Hunter to protect all of you.

19:09.210 --> 19:12.990
Please cooperate,
so he can leave safely.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.010
Please wait.

19:19.330 --> 19:22.350
You possess such immense power.

19:22.350 --> 19:25.320
I think you must have your own reasons.

19:25.850 --> 19:29.000
I won't ask why you took
on the role of porter.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.100
But...

19:31.670 --> 19:36.280
Because of you,
we were able to survive.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.240
On behalf of my team,
I express my gratitude.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.920
Ah, right.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.210
Here's your will.

19:49.210 --> 19:50.230
Huh?

19:52.250 --> 19:53.910
Then, let's get going.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.050
- Ah...
- Vice Master.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.050
Yes?

20:00.420 --> 20:02.810
Why are you holding a pickaxe?

20:02.810 --> 20:03.520
Huh?

20:05.270 --> 20:07.980
Would he think I'm weird?

20:07.980 --> 20:09.480
Who are you referring to?

20:09.480 --> 20:10.860
Ah... No one...

20:10.860 --> 20:12.600
I'm not referring to anyone.

20:15.150 --> 20:18.450
Fortunately, everyone came back safely.

20:18.990 --> 20:20.070
Having said that,

20:20.070 --> 20:24.910
following the White Tiger Guild,
we also received his help.

20:25.620 --> 20:30.000
He can summon a large number of soldiers.
His speed is equal to an assassin-type Hunter.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.880
He even has the ability
to control dead magic beasts.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.990
It's really hard to believe.

20:36.350 --> 20:39.090
Hunter Son,
between Hunter Sung Jinwoo and me,

20:39.090 --> 20:41.020
who do you think is stronger?

20:44.930 --> 20:49.900
Raid missions are usually handled
by multiple Hunters doing their part,

20:49.900 --> 20:52.480
complementing each other's weaknesses.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.770
That's the common sense.

20:56.150 --> 21:00.550
Master, if you're facing the most
difficult A-Rank dungeon,

21:00.550 --> 21:03.210
could you deal with it alone?

21:04.740 --> 21:06.620
No.

21:06.620 --> 21:11.000
It seems that my title of
the Ultimate Hunter has become a joke.

21:12.630 --> 21:13.530
Master!

21:14.590 --> 21:15.880
I understand.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.380
Please bring him over.

21:18.050 --> 21:19.780
I will do my best.

21:25.310 --> 21:26.350
Sir!

21:29.520 --> 21:31.270
Sorry, I'm late.

21:31.660 --> 21:34.200
How did the matter of the guild master go?

21:34.860 --> 21:36.710
You have talked to your dad, right?

21:37.940 --> 21:39.240
Sir...

21:39.690 --> 21:42.360
To be honest, that thing...

21:43.450 --> 21:45.080
- We're right outside
- That's really nice.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.370
- the Hunter's Association now.
- That's really nice.

21:46.370 --> 21:47.700
Actor Lee Minsung has awakened

21:47.700 --> 21:50.630
- These people must have come to interview me.
- the power of a Hunter recently.

21:51.660 --> 21:54.920
Lee Minsung, the man who has it all,

21:54.920 --> 21:59.050
now possesses strength that
surpasses human capabilities, huh?

21:59.630 --> 22:00.720
Well...

22:01.340 --> 22:02.660
Doesn't feel bad.

22:41.050 --> 22:43.720
SOLO LEVELING

22:43.720 --> 22:47.220
EPISODE 18: DON'T LOOK DOWN ON MY GUYS

23:36.270 --> 23:39.980
