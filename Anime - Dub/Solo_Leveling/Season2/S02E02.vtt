WEBVTT

00:12.929 --> 00:13.972
Arise.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.446
Very good.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.123
How long has it been?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.791
About three hours or so.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.503
It's been about three days inside.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.548
The environment inside is harsh.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.299
Alas.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.427
I guess Sung Jinwoo must have died.

02:17.595 --> 02:18.972
I made a wasted trip.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.601
No, wait.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.980
Sung Jinwoo isn't from
the White Tiger Guild.

02:27.564 --> 02:31.860
Then why did he go through the gate
with your assault team?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.573
He is my friend.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.284
He was interested in a Level-C quest.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.994
That's why I brought him along.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.455
Alright. I see.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.795
Did you think I would say that?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.715
What are you up to?

02:53.798 --> 02:57.844
I know you love new things.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.763
Hwang Dongsoo.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.474
Let go.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.852
Are you ordering me?

03:05.935 --> 03:09.480
As a guild master from a small country?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.441
What did you say?

03:14.527 --> 03:16.112
This is bad.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.697
If we don't stop them,

03:17.780 --> 03:20.658
a fight between S-Rank hunters
will happen.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.410
So, you want a fight?

03:38.426 --> 03:39.636
<i>It's because it's too cold.</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:44.557
<i>No. As long as I have gear,</i>
<i>I won't lose at all.</i>

03:47.185 --> 03:49.812
<i>No wonder I didn't see any Ice Bears.</i>

03:50.521 --> 03:53.024
<i>Did the E-Rank hunters kill them all?</i>

03:53.983 --> 03:56.611
<i>Impossible. They couldn't possibly do it.</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:01.699
I got it. It's the White Demon.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.369
The White Demon is here. Darn it.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.167
Pretty impressive.

04:13.378 --> 04:17.215
If you hadn't held back your strength,

04:17.298 --> 04:19.509
my arm might have been broken already.

04:21.719 --> 04:25.390
I don't know what you are suspecting.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.058
But about two months ago,

04:27.141 --> 04:29.852
I tested Mr. Sung's magic power again.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.815
He is indeed an E-Rank hunter.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.817
That's the investigation result.

04:35.900 --> 04:40.363
And magic beasts killed Hwang Dongsuk.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.284
That's your word on that.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.661
What an obvious lie.

04:46.744 --> 04:50.832
I guess Mr. Yoo actually murdered him.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.503
Why did you go after Sung Jinwoo?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.798
Well, of course,

04:59.382 --> 05:00.967
it was just an excuse.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.511
An excuse to kill.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.145
He is a lucky guy.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.316
Mr. Hwang.

05:16.941 --> 05:21.446
I know Mr. Sung's strength well.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.324
He will definitely come out alive.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.829
I lost all my money for weapons.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.290
No, I mean it.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.791
It's a big gap.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.254
<i>Weak people, how are you still alive?</i>

05:39.255 --> 05:42.216
<i>You even have warm clothes, blankets,</i>
<i>tents, and food.</i>

05:43.384 --> 05:46.429
<i>I get it. So that's what it was.</i>

05:47.597 --> 05:48.973
You bad guys.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.975
Mr. Kim?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.936
The assault team has been annihilated

05:54.020 --> 05:56.397
because we lack food and gear.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.690
That is…

05:57.774 --> 05:59.650
Who hid these things?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.527
Who hogged all the gear

06:01.611 --> 06:03.529
and got other teammates killed?

06:04.614 --> 06:05.990
<i>I figure it out now.</i>

06:06.074 --> 06:07.867
Heejin.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.453
<i>You knew it, didn't you?</i>

06:10.536 --> 06:12.413
<i>That's why you joined this team.</i>

06:12.497 --> 06:15.625
Confess, or you'll be accomplices.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.336
I'll count to three. Confess honestly.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.797
One.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.758
-Two.
<i>-The culprit is that guy.</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:25.885
Sung Jinwoo.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.261
Three.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.563
You got your teammates killed.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.606
Sung.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.982
Captain.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.527
You even brought us trouble.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.570
Show up.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.615
You can't hide your strong presence.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.869
They are Ice Demons.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.704
We're outnumbered.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.915
Is he the boss?

07:00.711 --> 07:02.421
Among the trash,

07:02.505 --> 07:05.133
there is someone useful.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.009
What did you say?

07:07.093 --> 07:10.888
Are you saying we're all trash?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.933
Oh, that's really surprising.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.395
Kid, can you understand our language?

07:17.478 --> 07:19.647
<i>Huh? Why can I understand it?</i>

07:19.730 --> 07:22.817
Can you understand their language?

07:23.651 --> 07:25.862
<i>Is this because of the system?</i>

07:25.945 --> 07:29.031
If so, that would be perfect.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.075
This guy told me

07:32.118 --> 07:35.079
there's an expert among humans.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.832
He wanted to compete with you.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.632
And then?

07:48.926 --> 07:50.344
Interesting.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.853
It seems I can't beat him quickly.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.939
It's getting more interesting.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.233
That being said,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.486
you're clearly not human.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.488
Why are you mingling among humans?

08:09.071 --> 08:10.072
What?

08:10.865 --> 08:14.410
You don't even know who you are.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.205
We keep hearing a voice.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.165
It tells us to kill humans.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.376
But when facing you, I can't hear it.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.462
<i>Hear a voice?</i>

08:25.463 --> 08:28.132
<i>Is it something similar</i>
<i>to system commands?</i>

08:28.216 --> 08:31.010
<i>He can't hear anything when facing me.</i>

08:31.093 --> 08:33.387
<i>Is it because I've become a player?</i>

08:33.471 --> 08:35.806
There is no need for us to fight.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.935
Let's have the best of both worlds.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.312
Hand over the humans behind you,

08:41.395 --> 08:43.773
and we will spare your life.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.899
What do you think?

08:44.982 --> 08:46.943
How do you find this proposal?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.987
Who are you?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.864
Why do you fight humans?

08:52.865 --> 08:54.242
We are…

08:56.327 --> 08:58.538
Hand over the humans behind you,

08:58.621 --> 09:02.416
and we will spare your life.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.627
<i>What just happened?</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:07.505
What do you think?
How do you find this proposal?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.340
You're going to accept it, right?

09:12.510 --> 09:13.344
I refuse.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.848
Are you planning to be our enemy?

09:17.932 --> 09:20.893
For the record, you're outnumbered.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.479
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

09:32.363 --> 09:33.531
What is this?

09:33.614 --> 09:36.242
They're monsters. Monsters have appeared.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.370
Black soldiers and black Ice Bears.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.746
What?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.915
Mr. Sung, did you summon them?

09:43.791 --> 09:46.252
It's no use making a death struggle.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.837
A death struggle?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.630
Is it really so?

10:06.772 --> 10:07.648
Get away.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.693
It's not a battle we can be in.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.286
<i>He truly has the capacity to boast.</i>

10:20.828 --> 10:24.457
<i>Soldiers can't be killed,</i>
<i>but they need MP.</i>

10:25.124 --> 10:27.209
<i>I'm running out of the MP.</i>

10:27.793 --> 10:31.714
<i>Anyway, their boss looks stronger than me.</i>

10:38.262 --> 10:41.682
<i>I can't even defeat him with Igris.</i>

10:42.266 --> 10:43.893
<i>Regular soldiers can't end this fight.</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:47.313
<i>I need stronger combat power.</i>

10:47.396 --> 10:49.023
My name is Baruka.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.609
What's your name?

10:53.944 --> 10:55.237
Sung Jinwoo.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.433
I love this exciting battle.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.367
The last voice I heard…

11:46.247 --> 11:48.374
Sung Jinwoo.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.712
<i>Luckily, the soldiers bought me time.</i>

11:54.255 --> 11:55.214
<i>Next up is…</i>

11:56.173 --> 11:58.884
Is this all your soldiers can do?

12:00.344 --> 12:02.430
Sung Jinwoo.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.223
Just die!

12:04.306 --> 12:06.600
Even a human has betrayed you.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.441
Utterly boring.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.318
What a cheap trick.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.580
Sung Jinwoo. Just die!

12:28.247 --> 12:31.167
Kim Chul. I knew it.

12:36.755 --> 12:37.631
Utterly boring.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.638
Sung Jinwoo. You guy.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.391
From the very beginning,

12:47.975 --> 12:51.061
did you anticipate that I would come?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.022
Darn it.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.609
<i>Arise.</i>

12:59.028 --> 13:01.280
What a cheap trick.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.171
Iron.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.841
From today on, you will be called Iron.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.893
Quite interesting.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.812
I'll start by getting rid of you.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.531
You are moving way too slowly.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.036
Heejin.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.248
This is how hunters fight?

13:53.332 --> 13:57.002
If that's the case,
how could I possibly become a hunter?

13:57.086 --> 13:59.380
I have never seen this before.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.174
We're not dreaming, right?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.846
This guy can't fight me.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.516
You and that knight,

14:10.599 --> 14:13.102
come at me together.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.478
Is that so?

14:26.198 --> 14:29.618
First of all, take you down.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.714
<i>He actually avoided the vital areas.</i>

14:43.257 --> 14:46.594
You are underestimating me too much.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.263
You are indeed very strong.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.308
However, your men are not.

14:59.773 --> 15:04.278
But if you die,
those guys won't be an issue.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.074
You idiot, you threw away your weapon.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.418
Iron.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.440
Pretty good.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.653
I'm going to kill all of you.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.365
The outcome has been decided.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.951
Are you kidding me?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.370
It's not over yet.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.589
I told you.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.010
The outcome has already been decided.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.517
Have I finally defeated him?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.482
Hey. Stop.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.944
Don't go too far.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.406
I'm worried about your future.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.546
It's over, isn't it?

16:46.130 --> 16:46.964
Yes.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.676
Let's go.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.015
To the outside of the gate.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.394
Great.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.772
We can go home now.
We can finally get out.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.982
What a day.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.650
We can go back now.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.445
<i>Before that,</i>

17:13.699 --> 17:17.911
it's been almost a week inside.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.622
We will stay here on standby.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.499
Mr. Baek, you go back.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.960
My members are trapped inside.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.920
I can't just go back.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.547
I'll wait here until dawn.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.843
There's a shadow. Someone is coming out.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.304
<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

17:35.888 --> 17:38.390
<i>I knew you could do it.</i>

17:39.975 --> 17:41.351
Mr. Baek.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.645
Miss Park.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.441
Mr. Go. ̀It's good that you're alright.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.359
How are the other hunters?

17:58.452 --> 17:59.703
Mr. Sung.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.997
I knew it.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.171
The gate has disappeared.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.298
What about the other hunters?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.050
Where is Mr. Kim?

18:13.133 --> 18:14.134
So,

18:15.344 --> 18:18.097
only low-rank hunters survived?

18:18.180 --> 18:20.557
What exactly happened inside?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.851
Go back. I'll take you home.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.686
Okay.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.107
Please wait. May I have a word with you?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.193
I'm already tired.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.737
Whatever it is, ask the guild.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.949
<i>This is not a request.</i>

18:37.032 --> 18:39.660
<i>It's an order, even a threat.</i>

18:40.244 --> 18:44.748
In this incident,
six members of our guild went missing.

18:45.332 --> 18:49.419
I'm in charge and must ask you something.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.965
That makes sense.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.926
But I saved two members of yours.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.302
As the person in charge,

18:57.386 --> 19:00.305
shouldn't you thank me first?

19:06.061 --> 19:07.771
Please forgive my rudeness.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.439
You are right.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.317
I am truly sorry.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.615
-Miss Park.
-Yes?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.576
What's wrong with that guy?

19:21.201 --> 19:23.328
Why did he seem so mad?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.329
I don't know either.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.248
After defeating the boss,

19:26.331 --> 19:28.542
he got in a bad mood.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.296
I think he must feel quite exhausted.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.214
He is not a bad person.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.759
Mr. Ahn.

19:37.843 --> 19:42.264
Make sure to bring him to our guild.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.223
Yes.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.645
<i>Indeed, I did not misjudge.</i>

19:51.648 --> 19:52.649
Thank you.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.276
Please be careful on your way back.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.360
Hmm.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.113
Well, Jinwoo.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.073
Jinwoo?

20:00.157 --> 20:02.659
Thank you for today.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.786
See you tomo…

20:04.870 --> 20:05.913
No.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.040
See you later.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.006
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:16.089 --> 20:19.468
<i>Not even a day has passed outside yet.</i>

20:20.135 --> 20:23.430
<i>Only this stuff looks good.</i>

20:24.681 --> 20:27.351
<i>Because there's a big gap</i>
<i>between him and me?</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:38.362
<i>Three attempts failed.</i>

20:40.614 --> 20:42.741
I worked all day for nothing.

20:43.825 --> 20:44.701
<i>No…</i>

20:49.790 --> 20:50.749
<i>Well…</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:53.585
<i>It's the third time already.</i>

20:57.839 --> 21:00.842
Brother. I'm going to eat your breakfast.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.594
I'm coming out.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.682
Good morning.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.851
You came over in this costume?

21:09.935 --> 21:12.562
Yes. Alright, let's head out.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.440
Whatever.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.068
-We'll pick someone up on the way.
-Eh?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.406
Good morning, Captain.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.992
Ah… Yeah. Good morning.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.828
Sorry for the trouble. Jinwoo.

21:28.870 --> 21:29.788
<i>Jinwoo?</i>

21:30.539 --> 21:31.748
Did you get some sleep afterward?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.126
I couldn't sleep at all.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.628
Right, it was morning
by the time you got home.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.588
-Yeah.
<i>-Got home?</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:40.132
<i>-Didn't sleep at all?</i>
-How about you, Jinwoo?

21:40.215 --> 21:43.218
<i>You two spent the night together?</i>

21:43.885 --> 21:44.970
You take a nap.
I'll wake you when we arrive.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.681
-Thank you.
<i>-Um… Boss?</i>

21:48.348 --> 21:51.393
Miss Han is underage.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.520
So?

21:58.108 --> 21:59.568
Nothing…

21:59.651 --> 22:00.902
Nothing…

22:03.113 --> 22:04.990
Let's set off and get it done soon.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.450
Yes, Jinwoo.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.201
Yes.
