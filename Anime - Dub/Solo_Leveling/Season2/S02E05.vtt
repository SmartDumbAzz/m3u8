00:08.700 --> 00:12.410
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

01:38.580 --> 01:40.500
What are you doing there?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.800
I'll ask one more time...

01:44.540 --> 01:46.790
What are you doing there?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.630
How careless...

01:51.630 --> 01:53.510
What was I thinking?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.290
I got lost and ended up here.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.140
Got lost?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.350
Are you from the mining team?

02:01.350 --> 02:04.060
This is the Boss Room.
Please step back.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.490
Cha Hae-In.

02:06.190 --> 02:08.020
She truly lives up to her reputation.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.570
I didn't notice her at all
until she spoke.

02:13.050 --> 02:13.910
Did I see it wrong?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.790
Wasn't he just holding a weapon?

02:16.790 --> 02:17.620
I am sorry.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.290
Please hurry out.

02:20.290 --> 02:24.780
If you agitate the Boss,
the mining team may get annihilated.

02:24.780 --> 02:25.710
I understand.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.010
Umm, hold on.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.590
Yes?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.520
He isn't smelly.

02:46.110 --> 02:47.440
What are you doing?

02:47.980 --> 02:50.460
Are you really a Hunter?

02:51.190 --> 02:52.750
Uh, yes...

02:54.860 --> 02:56.410
E-Rank...

02:56.410 --> 02:57.450
Sung Jinwoo.

03:01.290 --> 03:02.750
It's nothing.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.420
Be careful on your way back.
This dungeon is very large.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.500
Okay.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.960
Is it because his rank is too low?

03:13.460 --> 03:14.920
He's not smelly at all.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.170
On the contrary,
he smells rather pleasant.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.770
I heard you met Hunter Cha
when you were lost.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.600
You are so lucky.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.060
We can only admire her from a distance.

03:31.730 --> 03:38.030
She patrols to protect us from the Boss,
sacrificing her own rest time.

03:38.490 --> 03:40.490
She is a very reliable young woman.

03:40.990 --> 03:42.790
That's why she came
to the Boss Room.

03:43.620 --> 03:47.580
Hunter Cha feels uncomfortable
with the scent of other Hunters.

03:47.580 --> 03:50.250
The scent of Hunters?

03:50.250 --> 03:52.630
I heard it's due to her unique constitution.

03:52.630 --> 03:55.850
She always covers her nose
with a handkerchief.

03:55.850 --> 03:56.470
Yeah.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.180
But her reaction to me...

04:01.180 --> 04:04.390
I don't have the distinct scent of a Hunter.

04:05.220 --> 04:08.870
In the Red Gate,
that guy said something similar.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.400
Is it because I am a player?

04:13.110 --> 04:15.990
The only one favored by the system.

04:16.570 --> 04:19.450
What exactly is the so-called player?

04:20.530 --> 04:22.410
Thank you for your work.

04:22.410 --> 04:23.740
Thank you.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.330
Thanks to you,
we finished work early.

04:26.790 --> 04:29.960
Never thought we'd finish earlier
than the recovery team.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.250
You have a talent for this.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.300
I thought you secretly used the excavator.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.920
You flatter me.

04:37.380 --> 04:39.180
I've been in this field for a long time,

04:39.180 --> 04:42.170
but I've never come across
a talent like you, Sung.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.520
Sung.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.520
Are you interested in working for me?

04:49.100 --> 04:50.480
You'll be rewarded fairly.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.980
Well... I'm glad to hear you say so.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.440
But this is a one-time thing for me.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.780
I see.

04:58.780 --> 04:59.950
That's a pity.

05:00.610 --> 05:03.510
But could you help for one more day?

05:03.950 --> 05:05.170
One more day?

05:05.170 --> 05:05.870
Yes.

05:05.870 --> 05:09.910
Tomorrow, there are back-to-back
A-Rank and C-Rank raid missions.

05:10.540 --> 05:12.790
I have a re-evaluation the day after tomorrow.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.880
Today, I've gotten a grip
on the raid process.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.090
Wait... Tomorrow?

05:18.880 --> 05:21.260
Hunters Guild also have
raid missions tomorrow?

05:21.260 --> 05:23.180
A-Rank and C-Rank missions simultaneously?

05:23.180 --> 05:24.010
Yes.

05:24.010 --> 05:27.560
But the 2nd assault team
will be coming tomorrow.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.810
The 2nd assault team...

05:29.310 --> 05:31.640
That is our strength.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.730
We can raid A-Rank Gates
with two groups of people.

05:34.730 --> 05:37.150
No one else in the country can do it.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.150
Then, where should I report tomorrow?

05:40.950 --> 05:42.820
So you are willing to help?!

05:43.270 --> 05:46.330
I will talk to the boss about
doubling your salary tomorrow!

05:46.330 --> 05:48.080
Eh? But you don't have to...

05:48.080 --> 05:51.040
Come on, that's the least I could do.

05:54.250 --> 05:59.710
Could you help investigate
Sung Jinwoo in the mining team?

05:59.710 --> 06:01.220
Do you mean Hunter Sung?

06:01.590 --> 06:03.210
Do you know him?

06:03.210 --> 06:07.720
Mr. Choi said the same to me yesterday.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.060
Mr. Choi?

06:09.060 --> 06:10.060
Yes.

06:10.060 --> 06:13.460
But all the information about him
has been sealed.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.020
Eh?

06:14.360 --> 06:16.110
I've never seen the association

06:16.110 --> 06:19.220
seal someone's information
who isn't a top-level hunter before.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.170
I see.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.650
His behavior in the dungeon...

06:27.160 --> 06:29.410
Mr. Choi ordered an investigation...

06:29.790 --> 06:31.270
The blocked information...

06:32.310 --> 06:34.330
There must be something behind it.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.540
I've met so many Hunters.

06:39.090 --> 06:43.010
But this is my first time
meeting someone with a nice scent.

06:48.510 --> 06:50.010
Oh, he's here!

06:50.450 --> 06:51.520
Sung!

06:51.520 --> 06:53.130
Good morning.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.150
Sung, have you been eating well?

06:58.650 --> 07:00.020
Hi, Sung.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.690
Jinwoo, please don't get hurt today.

07:07.570 --> 07:10.450
I haven't felt this way in a long time.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.040
Let's eat together today.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.040
Yeah, you came after all.

07:16.040 --> 07:16.840
Okay.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.590
Alright, let's start with the C-Rank dungeon.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.300
The assault team is about to come out.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.510
Let's get ready.

07:25.590 --> 07:27.550
He's doing a great job again.

07:27.550 --> 07:29.050
Mm-hmm.

07:30.180 --> 07:33.140
With Sung here, our progress is much faster.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.020
Thanks to you, we can rest and go into
the A-Rank dungeon after lunch.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.880
The recovery team is also amazed.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.190
Do you really not want to work with us?

07:42.650 --> 07:43.990
I'll pay you five times!

07:44.650 --> 07:45.820
I'm sorry.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.330
Excuse me.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.570
Captain Son Kihoon.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.730
Can I borrow someone
from your mining team?

07:54.730 --> 07:57.990
The person in charge of carrying
our luggage couldn't come.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.290
From us?

07:59.290 --> 08:01.790
The recovery team should
be better at moving stuff.

08:01.790 --> 08:04.590
They said they are also short-staffed.

08:04.590 --> 08:05.460
Hmm...

08:06.550 --> 08:10.550
If you go in with the assault team,
you will receive the risk allowance.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.730
Portering in an A-Rank dungeon
is not fit for low-rank Hunters.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.270
Offering more money
wouldn't change that.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.980
No one wants to go?

08:24.230 --> 08:25.570
I'll go.

08:28.490 --> 08:30.110
What? Sung?!

08:30.110 --> 08:31.490
That's too reckless!

08:31.490 --> 08:33.910
There are high-rank magic beasts inside!

08:33.910 --> 08:36.750
That money isn't worth
risking your life for.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.120
It's alright.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.250
Actually, I'm quite bold.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.340
It's not about being bold...

08:44.040 --> 08:47.300
He just joined the team yesterday,
so he doesn't understand anything.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.010
What is his rank?

08:49.010 --> 08:50.180
E-Rank.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.180
So please find someone else.

08:52.180 --> 08:54.600
No, he'll do it.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.850
Eh?

08:57.270 --> 09:01.100
I am the leader of this attack team.
My name is Son Kihoon.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.860
I am Sung Jinwoo.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.030
It's even bigger than yesterday.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.860
But the magic power is not as strong
as that of the Gate yesterday.

09:11.270 --> 09:12.760
Be assured.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.830
If it's too dangerous, they won't send us,
the second team.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.460
Six A-Rank and three B-Rank Hunters.

09:21.670 --> 09:27.840
Although there are no S-Rank Hunters,
they wouldn't be a second team in other guilds.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.050
Let's set off.

09:31.470 --> 09:35.220
Hunters Guild has two assault
teams of this level.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.980
The magic power inside
is less than yesterday.

09:46.690 --> 09:47.690
But for some reason,

09:48.410 --> 09:51.460
I have an ominous premonition
similar to confronting the Red Gate.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.660
I must be overthinking.

09:54.070 --> 09:56.030
Don't be nervous.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.660
Kihoon...

09:57.660 --> 09:58.970
Ah.

09:58.970 --> 10:01.960
All the Hunters here
led by the captain are very strong.

10:02.380 --> 10:06.460
If you stick with us,
you won't be attacked by magic beasts.

10:07.170 --> 10:08.670
Thank you.

10:09.510 --> 10:13.630
After this raid mission is completed,
I will be officially appointed as the captain.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.710
Although I'm not as good as
Captain and Vice-Captain,

10:16.710 --> 10:19.010
I'm nonetheless an A-Rank Hunter.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.570
I can do it.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.770
They got ready without any instructions.

10:33.610 --> 10:34.410
It's coming.

10:40.370 --> 10:41.930
It's Dungeon Jackals!

10:54.300 --> 10:55.130
Get down.

11:07.310 --> 11:09.690
Why are Dungeon Jackals
in an A-Rank dungeon?

11:10.740 --> 11:13.010
Are they rare magic beasts?

11:13.530 --> 11:16.200
Because they are C-Rank magic beasts.

11:16.650 --> 11:19.410
It wouldn't be surprising
if they all died in the dungeon.

11:21.830 --> 11:22.580
Collar?

11:23.450 --> 11:24.370
Please look here.

11:24.370 --> 11:26.290
It seems they were being raised.

11:26.790 --> 11:29.750
Do you mean they were spared
and used as hunting dogs?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.390
It seems my premonition was correct.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.610
High Orcs.

11:49.610 --> 11:50.940
How could it be?

12:05.870 --> 12:07.410
Their power is astonishing!

12:10.960 --> 12:12.760
He-ah!

12:14.840 --> 12:16.670
The taunting skill is ineffective!

12:16.670 --> 12:17.930
They targeted the back line?!

12:17.930 --> 12:19.130
Watch out!

12:21.800 --> 12:23.760
We won't be taken down that easily.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.640
That strike was ineffective?!

12:29.640 --> 12:31.360
Their magic resistance is too strong!

12:43.830 --> 12:45.290
It's too strong!

12:45.290 --> 12:48.080
I can only hold it back
for a few seconds!

12:48.080 --> 12:49.290
I'll summon help now.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.040
Those who obey my command,

12:53.670 --> 12:55.210
take the enemy's head.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.090
This is my trump card
that consumes a lot of MP.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.600
How about it?

13:16.070 --> 13:17.150
Healer!

13:17.150 --> 13:18.280
We need you here!

13:18.280 --> 13:20.110
Wait, I'll be right there!

13:20.860 --> 13:22.780
We are outnumbered!

13:22.780 --> 13:24.700
If we're surrounded,
we will be done for!

13:24.700 --> 13:26.660
Move in groups of three!

13:26.660 --> 13:28.080
Or we'll be dispersed.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.290
There are so many High Orcs
that can rival A-Rank Hunters alone.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.210
B-Rank members cannot
handle these magic beasts.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.680
Please, everyone, don't die!

13:52.560 --> 13:53.730
Next one.

13:53.730 --> 13:55.150
Don't move.

13:55.150 --> 13:56.690
I'll heal you right away.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.360
What just happened?

14:47.990 --> 14:48.740
What happened?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.330
These High Orcs suddenly...

14:53.500 --> 14:54.960
Now!

14:54.960 --> 14:56.290
Attack back!

14:56.790 --> 14:59.720
As an outsider, I really don't want
to stand out here.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.170
But I cannot watch people die.

15:07.970 --> 15:10.310
I must weaken them without being noticed.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.230
Don't play any tricks.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.640
Is anyone seriously injured?!

15:56.640 --> 15:58.520
It seems everyone's okay.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.900
It's a miracle that we're still alive.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.740
Hey, something weird happened
during the battle.

16:04.740 --> 16:07.850
I also felt that they suddenly slowed down.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.700
Gina, was it you who did it?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.280
I couldn't do that.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.100
I only know attack magic
and a little bit of telekinesis magic.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.370
And the other members
mainly focus on firepower, right?

16:19.790 --> 16:24.250
Without assassin-type Hunters,
that shouldn't be possible.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.970
But, no matter what, we won.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.550
Right.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.180
We're really lucky.

16:32.930 --> 16:36.390
That porter underestimated our assault team.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.560
With a magic caster on the team,

16:38.560 --> 16:41.800
how could he think that
his stealth skill wouldn't be detected?

16:42.690 --> 16:45.360
However, it's true that we survived
because of him.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.570
It seems he has his reasons.
So I'll let him off this time.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.250
Captain Son, do we still keep going in?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.620
This place is too dangerous for us.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.790
We need at least two more healers
and three more mages.

17:02.460 --> 17:05.840
I understand how you feel
about your first time as the captain.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.600
But, I also think we should retreat first.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.810
I can understand
he doesn't want to give up.

17:15.390 --> 17:17.560
Everyone wants to conquer the dungeon.

17:17.980 --> 17:20.520
But, if he is a wise leader...

17:21.520 --> 17:22.280
Then...

17:23.230 --> 17:25.150
Let's retreat for now.

17:27.570 --> 17:30.280
I was afraid you would
want us to keep going.

17:30.790 --> 17:33.030
I'm not that foolish.

17:34.410 --> 17:35.870
This is...

17:36.410 --> 17:37.830
A barrier.

17:37.830 --> 17:39.080
A high-level barrier.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.580
It wasn't here when we entered.

17:42.080 --> 17:42.960
Can we lift it?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.540
Given some time, I can do it.

17:46.880 --> 17:51.010
There's an entity capable of using such
high-level magic in this dungeon.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.530
Fortunately, we chose to turn back.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.970
We can't conquer this place by ourselves.

17:59.390 --> 18:01.140
What's this magic power?

18:01.570 --> 18:02.480
No way...

18:02.880 --> 18:04.310
The dungeon boss?

18:04.310 --> 18:06.020
We need to lift it.
Help me.

18:06.020 --> 18:07.070
Understood.

18:07.070 --> 18:07.770
Okay.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.860
Even a B-Rank Hunter can feel
such a powerful magical fluctuation.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.470
Why wasn't it detected outside the Gate?

18:20.620 --> 18:22.410
Curse magic?! Is it a trap?!

18:22.790 --> 18:24.620
Semi, cast divine magic!

18:25.820 --> 18:27.340
What's wrong? What are you doing?

18:35.010 --> 18:36.050
Captain Son...

18:36.050 --> 18:37.930
There are roughly 50 of them.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.520
- Kihoon...
- Don't move.

18:41.770 --> 18:43.980
We'll die pointlessly
if we fight them here.

18:55.950 --> 18:58.580
Helelakkohina.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.990
Vitualanaka.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.120
Helelakkohina.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.750
Vitualanaka.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.710
Helelakkohina.

19:09.710 --> 19:12.400
Vitualanaka.

19:13.130 --> 19:15.180
Humans.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.300
My name is Kargalgan.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.520
I wish to see you humans.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.350
Kargalgan.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.730
Did you block the entrance?

19:26.140 --> 19:27.770
Yes.

19:27.770 --> 19:31.110
I am the great sorcerer
of the glorious orc tribe.

19:31.570 --> 19:35.610
Is there a stronger being
than you in the cave?

19:37.740 --> 19:41.330
Who do you think can surpass me?

19:41.700 --> 19:43.450
Choose.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.540
Either die at the hands of my soldiers,

19:45.540 --> 19:48.000
or come to see me.

19:51.340 --> 19:52.710
We will come to see you.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.600
Hunter Sung.

20:02.220 --> 20:03.220
Yes.

20:04.930 --> 20:08.190
As soon as we see the boss,
we will attack immediately.

20:08.810 --> 20:13.420
No matter what, it should be distracted,
and cannot maintain the barrier.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.630
You take the opportunity to escape
and find the main assault team.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.860
Are you trying to get killed?

20:20.620 --> 20:24.490
Our mission is not to return
alive from the dungeon,

20:24.490 --> 20:26.120
but to close the Gate.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.670
I also have a favor to ask of you.

20:29.830 --> 20:31.840
This is my short will.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.850
Please pass it on to my family.

20:35.010 --> 20:38.300
We must complete our mission.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.260
But you are different.

20:40.970 --> 20:43.220
Please make sure you leave here alive.

20:44.260 --> 20:48.810
This desperate situation
is just like ours in the Double Dungeon.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.810
Those people back then...

20:52.400 --> 20:54.400
But these people...

20:55.110 --> 20:57.060
I'll take it for now.

20:57.060 --> 20:59.030
But I hope things
don't turn out that way.

21:06.410 --> 21:07.830
He isn't here.

21:08.290 --> 21:10.500
Did he resign from the mining team?

21:11.790 --> 21:12.960
Hunter Cha?

21:13.960 --> 21:16.920
Why did you come?
Isn't today your day off?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.640
May I ask if Hunter Sung Jinwoo was here?

21:20.640 --> 21:23.010
Ah, Sung.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.220
He just went in as a porter.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.520
Eh? Then...

21:28.140 --> 21:30.520
You mean he's inside the Gate now?

21:56.830 --> 21:58.800
Humans.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.430
Welcome.

22:41.010 --> 22:43.680
SOLO LEVELING

22:43.680 --> 22:47.180
EPISODE 17: THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE TRAINED TO DO

23:36.190 --> 23:39.940
