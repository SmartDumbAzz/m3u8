00:06.280 --> 00:09.490
SUNG JINAH

00:10.820 --> 00:11.980
Hello?

00:11.980 --> 00:14.700
Are you still sleeping?

00:14.700 --> 00:16.200
Ah... Yeah.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.210
I'm a bit tired...

00:17.500 --> 00:19.540
Do you know what time it is now?!

00:19.540 --> 00:21.670
Remember the parent-teacher meeting today?

00:25.340 --> 00:27.000
Umm...

00:27.420 --> 00:29.650
You are my brother, right?

00:30.130 --> 00:31.400
Why do you say that?

00:31.400 --> 00:32.210
Do I look strange?

00:33.300 --> 00:36.640
More than a decade has passed
since the Gate appeared around the world.

00:37.430 --> 00:40.690
The battle between the magic beasts
that exist in the dungeon of the Gate

00:40.690 --> 00:48.150
and the Hunters who have awakened
with special abilities still continues today.

00:49.150 --> 00:54.410
Sung Jinwoo, who has to earn money to
support his sick mother and younger sister,

00:55.410 --> 00:59.210
is at the lowest rank, E-Rank,
among the Hunters.

00:59.910 --> 01:03.630
Usually, the Hunters' abilities will no longer
be developed after awakening,

01:03.630 --> 01:06.000
and their ranking will not change.

01:06.580 --> 01:10.510
However, in the raid mission
of Double Dungeon,

01:10.510 --> 01:13.260
Sung Jinwoo seemed
to be entering a game world

01:13.260 --> 01:16.100
and obtained the power of leveling up.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.850
Sung Jinwoo, who continuously
improved his ability in the battle,

01:20.390 --> 01:24.470
finally got the recipe for the item of
the Elixir of Life, which can cure all diseases.

01:24.470 --> 01:27.860
And became the Shadow Monarch,

01:28.230 --> 01:30.270
who can command Shadow Soldiers.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.420
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

03:00.950 --> 03:02.160
2-A

03:02.160 --> 03:05.250
No, not strange.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.880
I can't see your teacher in sportswear, right?

03:09.210 --> 03:11.710
So people can change this much...

03:12.050 --> 03:13.170
Wow...

03:13.170 --> 03:14.880
He's so handsome.
Who is that guy?

03:15.340 --> 03:17.470
You really stand out in a crowd.

03:17.470 --> 03:20.390
You don't have a girlfriend, right?
How about I introduce you to one?

03:21.720 --> 03:23.770
- Shut up.
- Ouch...

03:23.770 --> 03:24.850
It hurts!

03:25.890 --> 03:29.770
Jinah is kind-hearted
and a good student.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.900
She's a role model for other students.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.990
As her teacher, I feel very proud.

03:34.570 --> 03:35.490
I see.

03:35.860 --> 03:37.660
She did well on her mock exam.

03:37.660 --> 03:40.450
I'm sure she could get into
a medical school.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.080
I hope you won't push her too much.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.200
I understand.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.330
That's all for today.

03:47.330 --> 03:50.460
But may I ask you one question?

03:51.380 --> 03:52.170
Please go ahead.

03:54.090 --> 03:57.130
If one day, Jinah becomes Awakened,

03:57.130 --> 04:00.140
would you let her work as a Hunter?

04:01.970 --> 04:02.720
No.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.520
I thought so.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.350
Umm...

04:07.310 --> 04:08.480
Mr. Sung.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.310
May I ask you for a favor?

04:17.320 --> 04:18.400
You are...

04:19.910 --> 04:20.990
Ah.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.120
Hmm?

04:22.120 --> 04:23.410
What's going on here?

04:24.330 --> 04:26.200
You know her, right?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.020
Eh?

04:27.830 --> 04:29.790
Are you Jinah's brother?

04:30.370 --> 04:32.040
It's a small world.

04:34.210 --> 04:38.300
I don't know what the teacher said to you,
but I'm not going back to school.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.510
And I won't give up being a Hunter.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.050
You're an E-Rank Hunter, right?

04:42.050 --> 04:43.760
You can't make a living in E-Rank.

04:44.510 --> 04:46.990
You might have made a bit of money
in the assault team,

04:46.990 --> 04:48.270
but that was an exception.

04:48.270 --> 04:51.100
If you're here to preach, then leave.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.440
Besides, aren't you an E-Rank Hunter too?

04:55.980 --> 04:57.690
I'm not persuading you to give up.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.200
Huh?

04:59.580 --> 05:00.400
Let's go.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.080
Welcome.

05:08.910 --> 05:10.210
Hunter Hwang Dongsoo.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.170
This country looks as shabby as ever.

05:15.800 --> 05:20.380
I never thought the chief of the Hunter's
Association would pick me up personally.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.510
How long will you stay here?

05:24.050 --> 05:27.270
I won't stay long in this country.

05:27.270 --> 05:28.770
Don't worry.

05:29.850 --> 05:33.520
You came back to the homeland you betrayed
to meet those two people?

05:34.730 --> 05:35.770
To see them?

05:36.180 --> 05:38.230
Don't play dumb.

05:38.230 --> 05:41.360
You guys in the Surveillance Team
can just pretend you don't notice.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.530
About whatever I do to them in the dungeon.

05:44.530 --> 05:47.870
First, the E-Rank Hunter,
and then the D-Rank one.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.960
Do you think you can stop me?

05:52.670 --> 05:55.750
With your poor ability,
you can't stop me.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.010
I'm just doing my duty.

06:07.390 --> 06:09.100
They are actually wings.

06:09.560 --> 06:13.940
The point is, they fell into the sea.

06:13.940 --> 06:17.360
They were trying to fly across the sea.

06:18.150 --> 06:20.610
They can't fly very far now,

06:20.610 --> 06:21.490
but one day...

06:23.490 --> 06:26.530
Anyway, we'll look for clues.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.960
Long time no see.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.500
Mr. Ahn, Mr. Hyun.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.460
Long time no see.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.710
I didn't expect that you'd contact me.

06:41.710 --> 06:43.280
It's really delightful.

06:43.770 --> 06:44.820
Hello.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.390
Ah, I met you before.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.920
I'm sorry for my request.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.030
That's all right.

06:52.030 --> 06:53.980
It's my pleasure to help you.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.690
I'm surprised you'll watch our training.

06:57.690 --> 06:58.800
And that girl too?

06:58.800 --> 06:59.690
Yes.

07:00.070 --> 07:02.320
What a perfect timing.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.860
This place has become a Gate area.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.160
A Level-C Gate appeared not long ago.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.540
Can you stop chatting?

07:11.540 --> 07:14.000
We didn't come here for a picnic.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.830
Sorry, it won't take long.

07:15.830 --> 07:16.920
Who is he?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.670
An A-Rank Hunter, Kim Chul.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.960
As you can see, he's a Tanker.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.050
A-Rank?

07:23.590 --> 07:28.180
It's an onsite practice to get familiar
with the environment.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.010
And he's the leader of this assault team.

07:32.010 --> 07:34.270
We applied to have you come and watch.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.250
So, it annoyed him...

07:35.250 --> 07:36.060
Hey.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.770
Good grief.

07:37.770 --> 07:40.270
I hate looking after E-Rank Hunters.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.530
And there are two E-Rank Hunters.

07:42.860 --> 07:48.570
Well, this assault team consists of one
A-Rank Hunter, five B-Rank Hunters,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.280
and two C-Rank Hunters.

07:51.780 --> 07:55.500
Plus the two of you, ten people
will do the raid mission.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.500
I thought if she realized the truth,
she would give up.

08:00.870 --> 08:02.710
But there are many people on the team.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.170
It would be pointless
if the quest is finished easily.

08:05.170 --> 08:06.150
Mr. Sung.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.720
This time, please stand by
and just watch.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.930
Give the newcomers more opportunities.

08:13.350 --> 08:14.490
I understand.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.850
Well, let's set off.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.810
Do you even need to say it?

08:23.110 --> 08:24.820
Mister, let's go.

08:25.220 --> 08:26.860
I'll follow in behind you.

08:40.370 --> 08:41.790
Something's off.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.670
This ominous feeling...

08:57.930 --> 08:59.310
Could it be...

09:01.220 --> 09:02.730
What exactly is going on?

09:04.360 --> 09:05.480
Mr. Sung!

09:06.280 --> 09:07.400
Mr. Ahn!

09:07.400 --> 09:09.240
Get in touch with the assault team!

09:09.240 --> 09:10.910
Do it right now!

09:12.950 --> 09:14.280
A Red Gate?!

09:14.280 --> 09:17.120
How come a Level-C Gate
became a red one?!

09:17.120 --> 09:19.540
I'll be there immediately!

09:30.510 --> 09:31.930
What's going on?

09:31.930 --> 09:33.390
The Gate has disappeared!

09:33.390 --> 09:34.970
So we can't get back anymore?!

09:35.970 --> 09:36.930
This is a Red Gate.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.730
Mister, what is a Red Gate?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.220
It's different from a regular Gate.

09:45.220 --> 09:49.440
It's a dungeon behind it where you'll
lose contact with the outside world.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.990
To get out, you have to defeat the boss
or wait until it collapses.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.660
The outside world can't intervene.

09:56.160 --> 09:56.660
Huh?

09:57.330 --> 10:01.120
And many magic beasts will appear.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.210
But that was a Level-C Gate...

10:11.720 --> 10:13.380
Enemy attack! Raise alert!

10:16.680 --> 10:18.430
T-Thank you.

10:18.890 --> 10:20.140
Don't mention it.

10:22.710 --> 10:24.060
Ice Elves?!

10:24.060 --> 10:25.520
From that place?!

10:25.860 --> 10:26.950
They are so far away.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.860
No wonder we didn't sense them.

10:29.810 --> 10:32.400
They targeted the weakest two persons.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.410
If it was two months ago, I'd have died.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.710
Mister...

10:45.150 --> 10:46.420
They're...

10:47.080 --> 10:48.040
Ice Elves.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.380
Their way of attack is brutal.

10:50.380 --> 10:53.270
They're like white evil ghosts.

10:53.270 --> 10:55.260
Hunters call them Ice Slayers.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.600
Attention!

10:58.100 --> 11:01.420
As you all know, in this place,
we're far from help!

11:01.420 --> 11:02.990
We're on a difficult Level-B quest!

11:03.500 --> 11:08.420
In this situation, I need you guys
to follow my command to survive!

11:09.500 --> 11:13.220
That said, even I cannot lead everyone.

11:13.750 --> 11:17.030
So now, we're gonna split into two groups.

11:17.370 --> 11:18.240
What?

11:18.620 --> 11:20.760
This is to make more people survive.

11:21.220 --> 11:25.500
If we stay here, we might freeze
to death or be killed.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.420
I'll make those who follow me survive!

11:29.420 --> 11:31.050
I will go with you.

11:31.050 --> 11:31.920
Me too!

11:31.920 --> 11:33.210
M-Me too...

11:35.170 --> 11:36.590
You can't.

11:37.290 --> 11:40.280
As you watch us here, you can't go.
So do you.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.060
Those below C-Rank
can't come with me.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.470
One day here is equal
to an hour outside.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.650
It could take months to defeat the boss

11:49.290 --> 11:51.690
or wait for the dungeon to collapse.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.860
I have to leave the dead weight here.

11:55.650 --> 11:57.610
Don't be too sad, you guys.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.180
Once we defeat the boss,
we'll go back.

12:00.180 --> 12:00.920
Excuse me.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.790
Can I join them?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.370
It's up to you.

12:08.670 --> 12:09.970
Is it sympathy?

12:10.450 --> 12:11.710
What a foolish woman.

12:12.990 --> 12:15.670
Kim Chul failed to notice that arrow.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.380
You're not an E-Rank Hunter, right?

12:20.730 --> 12:21.870
He is an A-Rank Hunter.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.890
Perhaps even higher.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.920
I'm glad to work with you.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.550
Me too.

12:28.980 --> 12:29.610
Hey.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.480
We'll take the main road over here.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.320
Then we'll head toward the forest.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.280
Good luck.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.950
Likewise.

12:42.950 --> 12:44.260
Be careful.

12:51.530 --> 12:52.710
Captain?

12:52.710 --> 12:53.810
Look, you guys.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.350
That is...

12:57.180 --> 12:58.260
Ice Bear.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.940
All those E-Rank Hunters are about to die.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.850
Looks like he was never trained.

13:05.530 --> 13:07.390
He will die in the end.

13:07.390 --> 13:08.310
Talk about bad luck.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.970
Wait a second.

13:09.970 --> 13:13.940
C-Rank Hunters and B-Rank Hunter Park Heejin
are on that team...

13:13.940 --> 13:16.320
Why did I think of him as the captain?

13:18.950 --> 13:19.860
Prepare for battle!

13:30.770 --> 13:33.670
Just try to save your own lives.

13:56.540 --> 13:57.570
Stop.

13:59.650 --> 14:00.660
What's wrong?

14:01.490 --> 14:04.240
Didn't you see the scratches?

14:04.240 --> 14:06.990
This is the territory of the Ice Bear.

14:06.990 --> 14:08.660
Let's turn back before we meet them.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.490
Let's go deeper into the forest.

14:12.900 --> 14:13.420
Eh?

14:14.020 --> 14:18.840
If it's the territory of the Ice Bear,
only the Ice Bear will be our enemy.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.860
They're weaker than smart Ice Elves.

14:23.590 --> 14:28.510
So if there are many Ice Bears here,
no stronger magic beasts will appear?

14:29.420 --> 14:31.810
I haven't thought about it.

14:32.930 --> 14:33.940
Anyway,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.190
it's so cold in this forest.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.400
Eh?

14:37.690 --> 14:40.610
INVENTORY

14:41.740 --> 14:42.820
Everyone put these on.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.530
Subspace magic?

14:44.990 --> 14:50.120
I remember a high-rank Hunter can only
have two or three low-level items.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.830
So warm.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.300
Who exactly are you?!

15:06.010 --> 15:07.800
I'm the one who brought you here.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.640
It's my responsibility to protect you.

15:10.190 --> 15:12.020
In return, don't ask me any questions.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.060
The same goes for you two.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.070
Please do not ask me any questions.

15:20.070 --> 15:22.030
Also, don't demand anything from me.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.460
Title change.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.580
The entrance is completely sealed off.

15:44.130 --> 15:48.800
If luck is on their side, some A-Rank
or B-Rank Hunters could get out alive.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.680
We can only depend on Mr. Kim.

15:54.310 --> 15:58.060
Frankly, apart from the assault team,
there are others who have entered.

15:58.770 --> 16:02.190
Sung Jinwoo is the one
who has caught my attention.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.400
What rank is he?

16:04.780 --> 16:05.940
He's an E-Rank.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.990
But I'm wondering
if he's Reawakened.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.030
Are you sure about that?!

16:13.200 --> 16:15.620
I haven't received his direct reply.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.590
What's the situation here?

16:25.210 --> 16:28.590
A big shot from White Tiger Guild
actually came.

16:28.590 --> 16:31.010
Did a Level-A Gate appear?

16:31.970 --> 16:33.470
Hwang Dongsoo.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.350
Long time no see, Baek Yoonho.

16:36.350 --> 16:39.310
I didn't expect to meet you here.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.310
Why are you on my turf?

16:41.310 --> 16:44.780
Aren't you supposed to be in America?

16:46.190 --> 16:47.860
Your turf?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.070
Then let me ask you a question.

16:50.990 --> 16:56.040
Why did you allow E-Rank Hunters,
non-members, through your Gate?

16:56.450 --> 16:57.140
What?

16:57.700 --> 17:00.020
I mean Sung Jinwoo.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.150
How does he know him?

17:01.830 --> 17:05.050
I've come a long way,
and it's actually a Red Gate.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.750
At least let me see him.

17:08.590 --> 17:11.340
Well, he'll probably die inside.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.670
Sung Jinwoo.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.310
You lucky one.

17:16.020 --> 17:17.730
Now it has turned into a Red Gate.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.880
Even Hwang Dongsoo can't fight you.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.690
But...

17:21.440 --> 17:25.360
I wonder if you can come out alive.

17:28.780 --> 17:29.990
LEVELED UP

17:30.280 --> 17:32.030
This is the Red Gate.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.990
I've gained lots of points.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.370
W-Who are you exactly?

17:40.370 --> 17:42.750
Bear meat is surprisingly tasty.

17:43.380 --> 17:46.180
We've been attacked less.

17:46.180 --> 17:49.590
But Mr. Sung took them down alone.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.470
There must be their lair nearby.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.880
We can't let our guard down.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.640
Anyway...

17:55.220 --> 17:58.970
Though he has fought for so long,
he does exercise after a meal.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.640
He is a strange person.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.360
Yes, indeed.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.030
Are the quantities about the same?

18:18.330 --> 18:19.450
Come out.

18:37.190 --> 18:39.770
This is your first battle.

18:46.650 --> 18:47.330
Go.

19:16.090 --> 19:17.140
MP

19:17.460 --> 19:19.550
Powerful shadow mages.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.350
The shadow infantry revived quickly.

19:21.770 --> 19:23.040
This exceeds my expectations.

19:23.820 --> 19:26.250
But I'm running out of the MP.

19:31.590 --> 19:33.190
So the boss has appeared, huh?

19:53.870 --> 19:56.460
All Shadow Soldiers are killed.

19:56.460 --> 19:57.840
And I've used up the MP.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.530
Igris.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.180
Wow.

21:03.700 --> 21:09.830
I would've stood no chance
if Igris used his sword back then.

21:10.790 --> 21:13.170
At my current level,
we're on equal footing...

21:13.900 --> 21:14.710
No.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.460
He might be stronger than me.

21:20.970 --> 21:22.340
Good job.

21:33.210 --> 21:33.940
Help...

21:36.710 --> 21:38.150
This is impossible...

21:39.390 --> 21:40.360
I'm...

21:40.820 --> 21:43.570
...about to become an elite member
of the White Tiger Guild.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.040
How can I accept this?!

21:48.660 --> 21:49.620
Captain...

22:41.050 --> 22:43.720
SOLO LEVELING

22:43.720 --> 22:47.220
EPISODE 13: YOU AREN’T E-RANK, ARE YOU

23:37.690 --> 23:39.980
EPISODE 14: I SUPPOSE YOU AREN’T AWARE
