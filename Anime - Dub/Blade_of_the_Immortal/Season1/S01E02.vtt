00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:22.178
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:29.385
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:36.593
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:43.333
Is that who you want?

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.968
Is red not good enough?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.986
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:01:02.357
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:10.424
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:17.200
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:24.705
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:39.196
The wings of hatred will not stop
so long as the heart makes waves.

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:44.427
| want to tell you something
before Takayoshi comes back.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:53.208
Because of my weakness,
we banished a man to the darkness.

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:59.480
If because of that,
misfortune should fall upon you...

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:02.610
...I don't want you to blame that man.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.214
Because it is
my father and I who are at fault.

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:08.216
Grandpa?

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:13.724
We must just accept it,
if we don't want to lose everything.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.806
What did you wish for?

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.210
That no misfortune
should fall upon anyone.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.061
Conquest

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.612
Mutenichi-ryu Asano Dojo

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:47.222
Golden Wasps!

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:03.177
You have trained so hard...

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:07.045
I, Kuroi Sabato, am deeply moved.

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:14.288
Although trying to defeat me with that
technique is but a dream of dreams.

00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:17.792
So beautiful...

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.900
It's like gazing upon
the face of a goddess.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.228
It was worth waiting these two years.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.666
| shall take my leave for now.

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:32.186
You're running away?

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.154
I trust in the Buddha of immeasurable light
You're running away?

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:33.988
I trust in the Buddha of immeasurable light

00:03:34.012 --> 00:03:38.176
I trust in the Buddha of immeasurable light
What I desire is your heart.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:45.682
Until that wish is fulfilled,
| will have you survive.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:04.369
You there, girl.
Who sleeps in that grave?

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:11.678
| can sense your thirst
for blood from back here.

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:16.016
But within your thirst
lies a deep despair.

00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:19.450
My father sleeps here.

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:25.257
| wish to avenge his death.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.895
How noble. How trifling.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.598
Even so, nobility and trifles
are not useful tools of revenge.

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:38.073
The most essential thing is...

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.504
...strength that is nearly inhuman.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:09.708
Does this person even exist?

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.973
He looks like a total moron.

00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:42.529
Hyaku, come on...

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:43.767
Shut up!

00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:46.106
What about this?

00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:48.509
That's the same as before. Look.

00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:57.615
Stop horsing around, Shinriji.
You cheated, didn't you?

00:05:57.722 --> 00:06:02.353
| didn't. We aren't betting money
to begin with, so why would I cheat?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.792
Then why haven't I won once?

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:06.891
So, Hyakurin...

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:10.130
...did you see that guy?

00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:13.299
No, what I saw was the aftermath.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.099
The Hundred-man Slayer, huh?

00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:19.974
I think I'd get along with him.

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:22.137
If he joins us.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:27.077
It'd be a problem if a guy
like that became our enemy.

00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:31.554
Either way, sitting here and
talking about it won't do anything.

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:34.959
I'll talk to the guys at the top.

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:37.395
You sound awfully confident.

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:40.226
It's better not to make a move till then.

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:41.731
I know.

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:01.780
You woke up, huh?

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:04.951
Whatever.

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:07.957
<i>Don't come out yet.
The splinters'|| head that way.</i>

00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:09.457
Okay...

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:19.304
Do you do them all that way?

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.807
Hell no.

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:25.668
Oh, I see...

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:33.844
Sorry, it's burned.

00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:38.354
What's wrong? It's delicious.

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:41.417
Thank you.

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:44.720
You're really not that scary,
which is a relief.

00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.257
You're Manji, right?

00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:54.272
An old lady named
Yaobikuni told me about you.

00:07:54.372 --> 00:07:57.899
You won't die no matter
who you fight with, right?

00:07:58.009 --> 00:07:58.886
Pretty much.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.121
Pretty much.
That means you're really strong, right?

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:02.375
That means you're really strong, right?

00:08:03.481 --> 00:08:04.492
Well, that's 'cause...

00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:05.693
Well, that's 'cause...
Please! I need your help!

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:07.776
Please! I need your help!

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.648
My father was a samurai and
was killed by people called the Itto-ryu.

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:16.626
Also, my mother...

00:08:18.196 --> 00:08:21.257
| want to destroy
the Itto-ryu with my own hands...

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:24.461
...and get my mother back from them.

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.197
But I can't do it on my own...

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.975
That old lady told me.

00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:35.308
That a strong man named
Manji vowed to kill 1,000 evil men.

00:08:35.413 --> 00:08:38.872
She said if I asked,
he would help me out.

00:08:39.317 --> 00:08:41.615
Gossiping old hag.

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:42.982
| beg you!

00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:46.387
Please help me destroy the Itto-ryu!

00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.119
Go on home before it gets dark.

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:51.987
Could it be... you want money?

00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:55.491
I'm not talking about money.

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.299
This happened a long time ago.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.008
| helped out a villain
and killed many innocent people.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.349
| don't want to do that anymore.

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:16.785
So if I'm gonna do it, I gotta
know who's good and who's evil.

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:18.246
Right...

00:09:18.356 --> 00:09:20.381
So who's bad?

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:28.024
Your father and those Itto-ryu guys...
Who's bad and who's good?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.990
Well, that's...

00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:33.930
Obviously it has to be them, right?

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:36.137
But who's to say?

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:43.679
When people are telling their own story,
of course they're the righteous ones.

00:09:44.849 --> 00:09:49.514
| don't wanna be the co-conspirator of
some "saint" who's playing the victim.

00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:53.023
| do that,
and I'm just another criminal.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.051
But they...

00:09:55.493 --> 00:09:57.621
Wasn't your father a samurai too?

00:09:57.729 --> 00:10:01.529
There's no good or evil
when samurai kill each other.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.931
| understand
what you're saying, Manji.

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:07.605
But...

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:08.938
But...

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.274
It's frustrating.
There were so many of them.

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.875
And to kill him like that... That way...

00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:23.146
Talk to me.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.884
What you saw with those eyes of yours...
What you heard with those ears...

00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:33.324
Tell me everything that happened.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.958
Maniji...

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:46.210
Infinity.

00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.206
Infinity.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.311
Mother, it's already past nine.

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:54.886
Maybe Father is having an affair.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.746
What are you saying, child?

00:10:59.023 --> 00:11:04.689
| said to him this morning,
"Father, I turn fourteen today."

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:08.756
He promised me
that he'd come home early.

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:13.001
Didn't you hear about the special
meeting at the dojo tonight?

00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:17.769
Something about those
attacks on the other schools.

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:21.240
Those men attacking
the other schools...

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:27.149
It's rumored that they used to be
our dojo's students... Is that true?

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:30.578
I'm not really sure.

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:36.160
Father!

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.228
Rin, get back...

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:39.888
Mother, it's Father!

00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:41.289
Honey!

00:11:44.102 --> 00:11:46.002
Forget about me.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.798
Both of you, hurry and run...

00:11:54.746 --> 00:11:58.580
So in other words,
what you were saying is...

00:12:01.386 --> 00:12:04.822
..."We won't surrender
to you bastards.” Right?

00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:09.818
I must defend my school.

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:13.095
| understand these things all too well.

00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:16.326
But it's all for naught.

00:12:17.902 --> 00:12:21.736
All the followers of the Mutenichi-ryu,
except for you alone...

00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:23.897
...have been killed.

00:12:24.308 --> 00:12:26.402
H-How could you...

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:31.138
I swear I'll kill you all...
even if it costs my life...

00:12:32.817 --> 00:12:35.081
"Even if it costs my life..."

00:12:39.457 --> 00:12:41.892
"Even if it costs my life..."

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.496
What should we make
of this simple, honest reply?

00:12:45.596 --> 00:12:46.306
Kuroi.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.820
Kuroi.
Yes, sir.

00:12:48.332 --> 00:12:49.561
Wait!

00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:56.398
Why are you doing this?
Why the Mutenichi-ryu?

00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:06.208
| heard that your style
has the same origins as our own.

00:13:06.818 --> 00:13:10.345
How can you make peace with
your ancestors after this betrayal?

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:19.325
Interesting words just now.

00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:22.266
Damn you... Don't touch my wife...

00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:26.599
Master Asano, you will die tonight.
So ['ll tell you this now.

00:13:30.007 --> 00:13:32.738
Then you can watch us
from the realm of the dead.

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:38.908
This is the beginning of our
long, long drama of conquest.

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:44.712
Fifty years ago...

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.257
My grandfather, Anotsu Saburo,
and your father, Asano Takayuki...

00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:54.628
...were rival kengo over
the Mutenichi-ryu's secret teachings...

00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:57.531
...which were granted
only once a generation.

00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:12.505
The bandits who attacked
them were all defeated.

00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:16.483
Asano killed four, and Anotsu nine.

00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:18.752
But...

00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:19.948
Expelled?

00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:22.621
| do not understand!

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:25.128
It is not about technique.

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:29.962
Anotsu, it is simply that the essence
of your swordsmanship is lacking.

00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:33.200
You must have seen it on that night!

00:14:33.304 --> 00:14:36.035
My swordsmanship
surpassed Takayuki's!

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.505
And yet...

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:40.439
| see your true intentions now!

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:44.846
You talk of "essence"
and such now, but the truth is...

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:47.350
...it's because Takayuki is your son.

00:14:48.052 --> 00:14:49.596
You never had any intention of sharing
the secrets with an outsider like me!

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.853
Mutenichi-ryu Certificate of Initiation You never had any
intention of sharing the secrets with an outsider like me!

00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:59.263
Anotsu, you know the words
of the Mutenichi-ryu doctrine.

00:14:59.363 --> 00:15:02.560
"Skill with the sword
begins with decorum."”

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:06.262
No matter how strong they may be...

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.534
...those who scoff at form can never
comprehend the way of the sword.

00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:11.608
But...

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.272
In battle the other day,
you fought with a sword in each hand.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.941
One was a blade from foreign lands.

00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:24.579
Our Mutenichi-ryu has
no tradition of two-sword techniques!

00:15:24.689 --> 00:15:30.355
Moreover, it is inexcusable
to use a foreign blade!

00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:32.953
I did that to protect you!

00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:35.123
Takayuki, say something!

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:37.702
| know you agree with me!

00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:41.467
Takayuki!

00:15:43.374 --> 00:15:46.605
Anotsu, you are
the son of a cloth merchant.

00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:50.341
Your confusion regarding
these concepts is understandable.

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:54.407
But if we do not preserve our
teachings, Mutenichi-ryu cannot stand!

00:15:54.685 --> 00:15:56.949
Mercy... Please have mercy!

00:15:57.054 --> 00:15:58.078
I---

00:15:58.189 --> 00:16:00.385
| defended you!

00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:02.892
Y-You bastard...

00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:05.324
Why?

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:12.461
Master Asano, what do
you think of the way of the sword?

00:16:13.237 --> 00:16:16.468
If this were
the Warring States Period...

00:16:16.574 --> 00:16:20.477
Even then, would you
stand by customs and formality?

00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:24.475
It wouldn't be like living
in a peaceful society.

00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:29.019
If you don't win, you die. The way
of the sword is the way to victory.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.488
When I look at you,
it becomes perfectly clear...

00:16:33.057 --> 00:16:36.493
...what happens
when people forget that.

00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:42.631
The contempt suffered by one expelled
from a distinguished samurai's school...

00:16:42.733 --> 00:16:45.202
...runs far deeper than we think.

00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:48.998
The stronger a swordsman is,
the lower he falls.

00:16:49.473 --> 00:16:52.738
There's no way back to the light, ever.

00:16:53.344 --> 00:16:55.779
| understand what you're saying...

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.680
...but that was fifty years ago.

00:16:59.884 --> 00:17:01.943
And my father, Takayuki...

00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:05.614
...was tortured by his own
weakness till the very end.

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.226
It doesn't matter what you say.
We've made our decision.

00:17:13.864 --> 00:17:18.233
| will destroy every
sword school in the country...

00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:21.736
...and unify them under the Itto-ryu.

00:17:22.173 --> 00:17:24.904
What? Have you lost your mind?

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:30.240
So, Master Asano, it's time
for you to die. Are you ready?

00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:37.616
Once we're finished here,
have your way with the wife.

00:17:39.023 --> 00:17:40.218
You bastard...

00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:41.614
Got that?

00:17:41.726 --> 00:17:42.955
Yeah.

00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:46.696
However, don't touch the daughter.

00:17:47.498 --> 00:17:52.197
I think you'll agree
that assaulting children is vulgar.

00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:56.139
Anotsu Kagehisa, you're scum!

00:18:06.117 --> 00:18:07.278
Honey!

00:18:12.923 --> 00:18:17.451
The bell rings against a heartless sky.

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:22.260
The raven caws, "No mercy."

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.705
All walk the path
that leads to nothingness.

00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:36.112
Is this the way of the samurai?
Ganging up on someone like this?

00:18:36.547 --> 00:18:41.109
Don't get the wrong idea. The only
two who fought were Anotsu and Kuroi.

00:18:45.222 --> 00:18:49.591
Take your own life. If you're
the wife of a samurai, it's your duty.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.431
Magatsu, stop taking charge.

00:19:01.338 --> 00:19:05.070
We don't like
wasting our time like you.

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:09.374
You think we're here for idle chitchat?

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.212
If you want a woman,
why don't you just go to a brothel...

00:19:13.317 --> 00:19:17.049
...instead of taking someone's
wife in a place like this.

00:19:17.154 --> 00:19:21.489
Taking a man's wife in a place
like this is what makes it interesting.

00:19:21.592 --> 00:19:22.903
You're such a kid.

00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:24.520
You're such a kid.
What?

00:19:30.134 --> 00:19:35.197
As you can see, this woman
has no intention of killing herself.

00:19:36.907 --> 00:19:38.397
Do as you please.

00:19:40.344 --> 00:19:42.005
Don't kill her...

00:19:42.379 --> 00:19:44.871
Don't kill my mother...

00:19:56.927 --> 00:20:00.363
Close your eyes and cover your ears.

00:20:22.586 --> 00:20:23.883
Does it hurt?

00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:30.128
Are you ready
to throw it all away for revenge?

00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:35.856
Then prove it right now.

00:20:37.434 --> 00:20:41.871
If it hurts so much, prove how
serious you are about this.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.371
B-But...

00:20:45.075 --> 00:20:47.373
What's wrong? You all talk?

00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:59.016
Then do whatever you want with me.

00:21:14.972 --> 00:21:15.871
Sorry.

00:21:25.516 --> 00:21:26.779
Goodbye.

00:21:28.452 --> 00:21:29.442
Wait.

00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:51.938
Let's go.

00:21:57.982 --> 00:21:59.108
Right.

00:22:03.454 --> 00:22:06.287
Will Manji save the girl...

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.257
...or will it be the girl who saves Maniji?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:15.129
Either way, it's the fate life brings.

00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:31.581
Sadly, I awakened...

00:22:31.682 --> 00:22:39.612
Overflowing reality is just...

00:22:40.457 --> 00:22:45.520
...more of the empty lies.

00:22:49.566 --> 00:22:57.566
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:22:59.243 --> 00:23:05.307
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:05.616 --> 00:23:12.886
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.255
| remember...

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.732
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:22.833 --> 00:23:29.136
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:29.273 --> 00:23:37.273
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.052
Where should I go?

00:23:55.232 --> 00:23:56.700
Infinite Preview

00:24:08.178 --> 00:24:09.668
Love Song
