WEBVTT

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:22.145
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:29.354
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.560
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:43.301
Is that who you want?

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:47.937
Is red not good enough?

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:54.953
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:01:02.324
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:10.428
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:17.407
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:24.649
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.581
Insolent brat!

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.999
Prisoner

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.505
No one told me
you were quitting the Itto-ryu.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:35.551
Of course no one did.
| haven't told anyone.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:39.050
| thought I should tell you first.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:46.358
| guess I won't be able
to stay here if I quit the Itto-ryu.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.990
What about Kage?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.330
I'm thinking about telling him today.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.435
If you quit the Itto-ryu, will you
quit being a bodyguard here too?

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.773
Not like I'm doing much
as a bodyguard anyway.

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:01.972
Isn't that good? It's easy.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.244
| feel like a gigolo
or something. I don't like it.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.013
Tai, you don't like to be a gigolo?

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.089
Mister, I can show you a good time.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.584
You'll make me hate you.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.405
Tai, you sleep with me in
the same bed when I say I'm cold...

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:30.737
...but you never lay a finger on me.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.872
Am I that unattractive?

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:40.108
Do you not like women
who sell their bodies?

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.383
Or do I look like
your sister who passed away?

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:47.326
You look nothing like her.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.656
What'll you do after you quit?

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.389
Well...

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:57.800
Listen, I can get out
of here in about two years.

00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:02.137
Right now, I have to work
to pay for my mother's medicine...

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:07.177
...but the doctor said
she might not last two years.

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.874
If I'm freed...

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.850
...my dream is to have
a family with someone.

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.245
Ren...

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.924
It doesn't really matter
if you throw me away.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.124
You're a great swordsman.

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:28.731
As someone who can live freely
with his skills if he needs to...

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:34.068
...you don't need to deal
with a whiny girl like me.

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:38.433
Don't have to deal
with me holding you back.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.875
Now ain't these interesting toys.

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.651
Will you accept the offer?

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:51.451
Just one question.
Who do these really belong to?

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.316
Um, well...

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:58.686
No ordinary warrior would carry these.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.034
I've been in
the business for twenty years...

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:06.799
...but it's rare to see swords
that reek so bad of blood and guts.

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:12.505
In this peaceful era, no samurai's
sword would ever be like this.

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:17.310
These probably belong to
a bandit or a deranged killer.

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:24.151
Well, it doesn't matter.
| won't ask for the particulars.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:27.089
Swords are made for killing, right?

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:29.752
Yes, you're right.

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:48.247
| see you know your swords.

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.482
I fell in love with this one.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.348
Must be a relic from the old Ezo era.

00:05:58.557 --> 00:05:59.547
Woman.

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:03.224
What do you think you're doing?

00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:12.662
Mr. Magatsu, I've been waiting for you.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.263
This young lady has
an interest in swords...

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:18.867
...and she's fascinated
by this blade of yours.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.177
Chinese swords are fine weapons...

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:31.450
...but they don't behave
like Japanese swords.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:34.458
They're too much
for most people to handle.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.497
Of course, that's also
what I like about them.

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:41.328
When a sword sharpener
works a masterpiece...

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:44.425
...he's pushed to his limits.
| was sweating blood!

00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:48.495
But the sweat just makes the cool
of the evening more pleasant.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.375
It's a good life.

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:51.840
Thank you, sir.

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:54.772
I'll be sure to come again.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.348
Thank you!

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.417
| can't fight here...

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.619
Samurai! Sir!

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:14.026
That sword...
Could you please sell it to me?

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.396
I'll pay...

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:21.730
| can pay up to thirty gold ryo.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.335
Please.

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:28.407
I'm not a samurai, just a swordsman.

00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:32.846
Miss, have you heard...

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:37.912
...of an Asano Dojo that was in the
Honsho district up till two years ago?

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:45.557
A couple of my comrades were
killed by the daughter of that dojo.

00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:50.266
Well, I can't believe
a single girl could do that.

00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:55.163
| wouldn't sell this sword
for any amount of money.

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:58.107
It's booty, so I can't say where I got it.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.943
But if you can tell me
where to find that girl...

00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:07.279
...then I just might consider selling it.

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:09.948
Well?

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:14.155
What?

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:20.163
Rin, do you know
how much thirty ryo is worth?

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.995
I'm used to being broke.

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:30.732
But can you handle never
being able to take a bath?

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:33.476
I'm sorry.

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:38.311
Why do you want
that person's sword so much anyway?

00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:43.183
That sword belonged to my father.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.590
Two years ago,
after my father was killed...

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:52.858
...every single sword
in the Asano Dojo was stolen.

00:08:53.498 --> 00:08:55.865
That sword was one of them.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.700
Originally, when my grandfather
was head of the dojo...

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:03.298
...that sword was enshrined
as a school treasure.

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:06.378
The Mutenichi-ryu dojo
is so strict about form...

00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:10.346
...that I wondered why a foreign
sword was treasured so much.

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:16.416
Maybe it was my grandfather's way
of paying respect to Anotsu Saburo.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:21.020
So what do you want to do?

00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:25.629
Did you ask where he's staying?

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:30.635
He's at an inn called the Mizoguchi
by Sensoji Shrine till tomorrow.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:34.730
If you want to go get it
back by force, I'll help you out.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.571
Manji, I'm sorry.

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:42.275
This is the last time I'll talk like this.

00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:45.373
I'm already sixteen...

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.009
...and I can't keep talking
about my mother and father.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.553
It's pathetic.

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:57.729
I've decided it's time to put it
behind me. That sword too.

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:01.390
Isn't he part of the Itto-ryu?
Don't you hate him?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.565
| hate him.

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:09.933
| hate him, but no matter
how many of the Itto-ryu we kill...

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:14.411
...as long as Anotsu Kagehisa is alive,
their numbers will still increase.

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:20.811
No more wasting time.
I've got to find Anotsu himself.

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:23.778
Or I can't destroy the Itto-ryu.

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:29.427
Well, if that's what
you want, it's fine by me.

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:39.233
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.770
Hey, stop!

00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:51.379
It's awfully quiet, isn't it?

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.583
Are you guys really
heading to Mukou-jima?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.054
It was Tempou Dojo
in Mukou-jima, right?

00:10:59.157 --> 00:11:00.283
Yeah.

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:08.165
I've heard rumors that the dojo
was a secret hideout for the Itto-ryu.

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.363
Do you think it's true?

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.700
Who'd you hear that from?

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:17.966
In this business, we just hear things.

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:22.978
By any chance, are you
a kengo of the Itto-ryu?

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:26.711
And what if I was?

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:41.163
Infinity.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.161
Infinity.

00:11:45.103 --> 00:11:48.164
Man, that was too quick.

00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:53.904
Even the most skilled kengo
are vulnerable to surprise.

00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:57.773
If people found out
guys like us killed him...

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:01.581
...he'd be too ashamed to show
his face in the afterlife. I pity him...

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.785
The guys in the Ittoryu...

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:14.030
...have endured all sorts of hardships.

00:12:14.132 --> 00:12:16.794
I've met people from all walks of life...

00:12:17.302 --> 00:12:21.569
...but this is the first time
I've seen swordsmen carry a carriage.

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.801
This is pretty hilarious.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.176
You bastard!

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:38.388
S-S-Shit... When did you...

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:43.825
Old man, you got cocky.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:49.158
| purposely missed your vitals.
You want to go to the doctor?

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:53.701
All right, cough it up.

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:55.868
Who sent you?

00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:57.806
W-What are you talking about?

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:03.541
If you're seeking revenge for a fallen
dojo, this sort of plan is a bit much.

00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:10.584
You'll die if you don't hurry up.
Spill it and I'll take you to the doctor.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.316
What'll you do?

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.353
What was that?

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:19.322
Akagi?

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:26.702
My bad. I guess that was a vital point.

00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:29.533
Please take this.

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:40.544
Mr. Magatsu, you came on foot?

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:41.949
Yeah, kind of.

00:13:42.053 --> 00:13:43.452
You're wounded...

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:46.654
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.097
Excuse me.

00:13:56.434 --> 00:13:58.459
Makoto, who was that?

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:03.032
His name is Habaki Kagimura,
one of the shogunate's guard.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:14.777
The Ittoryu is going
to work under the shogunate.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.759
It looks like you have something to say.

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:26.263
Not really. I think it's a good thing.

00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:30.494
Now you can go back to being
a samurai with no problem.

00:14:30.602 --> 00:14:32.832
As long as
you're with the shogunate...

00:14:32.937 --> 00:14:36.805
...no one's going to look down
on you as an outcast anymore.

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:39.844
That's what you wished for, right?

00:14:40.445 --> 00:14:43.142
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.218
We won.

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:51.820
Magatsu...

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:58.758
I'm not leading the Itto-ryu to make
some kind of invincible ronin group.

00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:01.961
| know that much already.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.932
We go way back after all.

00:15:05.837 --> 00:15:09.296
What the Itto-ryu hates most
is the fall of a samurai family.

00:15:09.407 --> 00:15:12.377
So I think you're doing the right thing.

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:21.810
Hey, is it okay if I jump ship here?

00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:24.216
Your reason?

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:27.417
It's not that I don't
like how you run things...

00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:31.428
...but I have my pride.
| can't be on the side of the samurai.

00:15:32.764 --> 00:15:35.597
Every time
we destroyed a dojo together...

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.931
...| felt so good,
but until now I haven't...

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:43.036
Nah, I'm not gonna say anything.

00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:47.300
I'm just being selfish.
You don't really care, do you?

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:53.379
You won't be tied down by the sword?
I thought you'd say something like that.

00:15:54.819 --> 00:15:58.084
Schools are such fragile things, huh?

00:15:58.723 --> 00:16:01.522
Especially the Itto-ryu.

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:04.954
See you.

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:06.624
Magatsu...

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:12.294
You can keep on using
the second floor of the Yukimachi.

00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:17.066
Wouldn't want to make Oren unhappy.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.977
Oh, yeah. As a parting gift,
or I suppose it's a warning.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.519
When did you cross paths
with a group named Akagi?

00:16:32.323 --> 00:16:34.758
Never. I don't remember them at all.

00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:39.225
If you should ever
meet them, watch your back.

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:43.857
They've been specifically
targeting members of the Itto-ryu.

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:46.903
I'll keep that in mind.

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:49.303
Well, that's all I gotta say.

00:16:49.707 --> 00:16:51.072
See you around.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:06.547
Rin.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:13.691
The only thing she's grown up
about is crying and sleeping.

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:19.032
You want revenge for your parents
to take the pain away, don't you?

00:17:19.737 --> 00:17:24.299
What'll you do if you're not allowed
to shed a single tear for your parents?

00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:35.617
I know it's a harsh memory,
but you'll forget about it one day.

00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:42.016
It's a pain in the neck
to force yourself to forget it.

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:53.895
I've finally found you.

00:17:54.005 --> 00:17:56.372
Are you working for that Akagi group?

00:17:56.474 --> 00:17:59.910
No I'm not. I'm not working for anyone.

00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:04.639
Anyway, hand over
that long sword at your waist.

00:18:07.585 --> 00:18:08.916
I get it.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.355
| was right.
That girl really is Asano's daughter.

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:17.496
You must be the one
who defeated Kuroi Sabato.

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:21.088
You can say that.
So what are you gonna do?

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.475
The first rule of war.

00:18:36.581 --> 00:18:39.983
Restricting your enemy's
mobility is 80% of the victory.

00:18:40.084 --> 00:18:44.021
Idiots who only aim for killing
blows will likely lose their legs.

00:18:44.422 --> 00:18:45.912
Thanks for the tip!

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.744
A hidden blade?

00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:10.410
Stop acting so surprised.

00:19:10.515 --> 00:19:12.574
I like you.

00:19:13.384 --> 00:19:16.251
Are all the Itto-ryu
samurai crazy like you?

00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:18.753
I'm no samurai.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.682
Besides, I quit the Itto-ryu.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.221
Oh, really.

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:29.466
It's about time, huh?

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.660
What the hell?

00:19:33.771 --> 00:19:35.364
The second rule of war.

00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:38.135
Know the land
and conquer the heavens!

00:19:43.948 --> 00:19:47.475
This forest was
the perfect playground for a kid.

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:50.555
| used to play here with my little sister.

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.117
But my sister...

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:57.557
...was killed by a samurai.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.825
Insolent brat!

00:20:01.766 --> 00:20:04.929
That's why I hate samurai!

00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:22.348
You can keep that.
Take good care of it.

00:20:50.281 --> 00:20:53.080
Hand over the scabbard too...

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.389
What the hell?

00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:14.430
You're not the only one...

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.435
...who's lived through harsh times.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.717
It's been an interesting night.

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:32.813
Let's do this again...

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:36.155
...assuming we both
live through the night.

00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:47.166
You idiot, I can't die...

00:21:49.807 --> 00:21:51.002
Manji!

00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:57.904
Manji?

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:06.856
Doing this on your own...

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.154
Who asked you to do it?

00:22:09.894 --> 00:22:13.023
I thought I told you I'd put it behind me.

00:22:14.031 --> 00:22:16.432
I told you I'd forget all about it.

00:22:25.643 --> 00:22:31.548
Sadly, I awakened...

00:22:31.649 --> 00:22:39.557
Overflowing reality is just...

00:22:40.424 --> 00:22:45.487
...more of the empty lies.

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:57.534
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:05.274
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:12.853
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.221
| remember...

00:23:16.327 --> 00:23:22.699
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:29.103
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:37.240
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:23:50.027 --> 00:23:52.962
Where should I go?

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:56.633
Infinite Preview

00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:09.613
Cry of the Worm
