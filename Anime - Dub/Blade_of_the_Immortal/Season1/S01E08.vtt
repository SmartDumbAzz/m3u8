WEBVTT

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:22.254
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:29.463
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:36.669
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:43.409
Is that who you want?

00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:48.046
Is red not good enough?

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:55.062
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:55.163 --> 00:01:02.468
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.534
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:17.117
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:24.758
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:37.303
| was having an old dream.

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:38.405
A dream?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.408
It's a foolish story.

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:44.935
When I was still a child...

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:50.177
...there stood before me a big dog
that looked like it wanted to kill me.

00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:52.886
Unfeeling green eyes.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.513
| learned fear.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:02:01.524
Suddenly, the dog's eyes flashed,
and the moment it bared its fangs...

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:06.625
...a deep shadow
ran out from behind me...

00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:13.200
...and with one stroke the dog was
cut in half, head to tail like an eel.

00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:17.935
He must have been
quite a brave warrior.

00:02:18.713 --> 00:02:20.203
Actually, no.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:24.480
It was a woman... a young girl.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.190
She seemed to be a bit older than
me, but she was definitely a child.

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:34.860
What really amazed me...

00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:39.623
...was that even though she killed
the dog from that distance...

00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:44.899
...the truth was she didn't have
a single drop of blood on her clothes.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.668
The moment I saw this...

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:53.038
...a wholly different “fear”
than before ran through my body.

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.141
What I still remember
clearly to this day...

00:02:58.252 --> 00:03:02.246
...Is the glimpse I caught of
her profile in the moonlight.

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.987
Her corpse-like pale skin...

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:12.522
...and her terribly sad-looking...

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:18.828
Pizzicato

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:28.372
Manji, do you believe
what Shizuma Eiku said?

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:34.745
If you want to find
Anotsu Kagehisa, go to Fukagawa.

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:40.489
You might run
into him, if you're lucky.

00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:46.327
It's something a man who lived
for 200 years said before he died.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:49.563
I'm sure it won't be
a waste to at least check.

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:54.597
Fukagawa's a big place though.
It'll be harder than I thought.

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.779
Hey, Manji.

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:09.718
As if they don't know it's a dream...

00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:17.563
...those who roam...

00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:25.098
...seek for a trace...

00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:32.435
...abandoning friends and mankind.

00:04:34.548 --> 00:04:35.913
They all left.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.918
My mother said not to run
because of my asthma...

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:43.046
Really?

00:04:43.858 --> 00:04:45.656
That's a pretty hairpin.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.159
This?

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:52.689
This is something
my mother gave me long ago.

00:04:54.902 --> 00:04:57.803
So why don't you put it in your hair?

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.138
You're right.

00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:07.537
Manji. Manji.

00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:08.714
Yeah?

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:10.716
I ran out of change.

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:14.253
I'll get some more, so wait for me.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:17.620
Sure... Hey, where am
| supposed to wait?

00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:19.352
Just stay right there.

00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:24.160
What, here of all places?

00:05:29.403 --> 00:05:30.370
Uh-oh.

00:05:31.906 --> 00:05:34.034
You look bored, friend.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.205
Whadda ya want?

00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:42.272
That didn't come out very refined.
How about a good time for 287

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.784
No thanks. Try someone else.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.950
Is it that girl just before?

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:49.921
She's attractive.

00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:53.627
| took her for a virgin,
but maybe I was wrong?

00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:58.295
I'm saying I'm not so pressed
I'd do an old woman. Now get lost.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.795
You can check
if I'm an old woman or not.

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:15.006
| see.

00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:18.680
Okay, come here.

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:29.791
Isn't it a bit early in
the day to be turning tricks?

00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:34.232
It's already seven o'clock.
The sun will set before we're done.

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:37.604
It's odd though.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:41.733
Why's a looker like you
picking up customers on the street?

00:06:41.842 --> 00:06:45.472
I'm too old to work
the red-light district anymore.

00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:48.477
Plus, a lot's happened.

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:51.613
Don't ask more than that.

00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:11.165
Then just one more question.

00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:14.267
What the hell's with this?

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:17.902
It's for self-protection.
| work alone, you know.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.687
What a joke. If it's for protection,
why's there poison on it?

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.917
Tell me who hired you.

00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:35.189
Well, I can pretty much
guess who it is.

00:07:35.296 --> 00:07:37.264
| don't know his name.

00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:39.492
It was a young samurai.

00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:42.366
With slanted eyes and long hair.

00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:47.572
Speaking of which,
| don't know what Anotsu looks like.

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:50.542
Slanted eyes and
long hair? Well, whatever.

00:07:50.644 --> 00:07:52.635
I'm pretty sure I'm right.

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:58.380
Forgive me.
H-He offered me twenty ryo...

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:02.116
That's more than someone
like me might see in a lifetime.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.793
If you say that's more important
than your life, then so be it.

00:08:06.894 --> 00:08:10.990
But don't complain about
gettin' killed if you try stuff like this.

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:15.099
Well, there's no point
in killing an amateur...

00:08:15.202 --> 00:08:20.163
...and my companion's coming back,
so see ya. Earn your money honestly.

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:40.690
I'm sorry for not saying
who I was earlier.

00:08:40.794 --> 00:08:43.957
My name is Otonotachibana Makie.

00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:50.836
The leader of the Itto-ryu, Anotsu
Kagehisa, is one I am pledged to...

00:08:51.272 --> 00:08:53.206
...as a swordswoman.

00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:58.040
Thanks for telling me so politely.

00:08:59.013 --> 00:09:02.972
Well, if both of us are experts,
there's no need to hold back.

00:09:04.518 --> 00:09:05.815
Bring it on.

00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:09.119
Prepare yourself.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.008
Don't move.

00:09:38.552 --> 00:09:41.385
You can't even
grasp your surroundings.

00:09:41.488 --> 00:09:44.651
You're holding back,
or is this all you've got?

00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:48.058
Either way, you don't have
any business with a blade...

00:09:48.162 --> 00:09:50.756
...if you're swinging it
around like you're stupid.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.630
Like I told you,
once someone picks up a blade...

00:09:56.737 --> 00:09:59.206
...they can't complain
if they get killed.

00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:01.502
Is this how you want to die?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.673
If you'd be a half-assed swordswoman,
then just be a streetwalker instead.

00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:09.909
It's for your own good.

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:16.280
Man, is the Itto-ryu
that hard up for peons?

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.018
How could they
send someone like her?

00:10:25.132 --> 00:10:28.124
Makie, just become a prostitute.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:31.864
You might as well,
instead of a swordswoman.

00:10:39.213 --> 00:10:40.510
Are you okay?

00:10:41.882 --> 00:10:43.976
You were watching me fight?

00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:47.380
From before that.

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:50.381
Miss, you're a swordswoman?

00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:52.692
Yes.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.384
You're weak.

00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:57.197
You want this?

00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:04.363
How come? Are you sure?

00:11:05.506 --> 00:11:06.473
Yes.

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:09.031
| don't think...

00:11:11.578 --> 00:11:13.239
...I'll need it anymore.

00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:15.246
Infinity.

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.243
Infinity.

00:11:25.626 --> 00:11:33.465
How do the forlorn go on living?

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:38.229
That's what the world calls dreams.

00:11:38.539 --> 00:11:46.105
The world hates mankind endlessly...

00:11:46.213 --> 00:11:50.775
It's not unusual to see someone
good at both singing and playing...

00:11:50.884 --> 00:11:56.687
...but I think it is to hear so much
feeling in it from someone her age.

00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:59.559
What do you think, sir?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.456
You got that right, Ohatsu.

00:12:03.163 --> 00:12:05.291
You're Omaki, right?

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:06.856
Yes...

00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:10.904
Come here and pour me a drink.

00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:19.571
I've seen your face
somewhere before.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:25.916
Oh, right. Till recently, there was
a girl who looked exactly like you...

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:30.547
...in this little red-light district on the
edge of town. Yeah, no mistaking it.

00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:36.491
Say what you like, but it's the face of
a women I slept with. I wouldn't forget.

00:12:36.597 --> 00:12:39.294
How does tonight sound?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.667
Sir.

00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:44.500
| think that's about far enough.

00:12:45.005 --> 00:12:47.440
We are just humble geisha.

00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:50.943
Women who market
our talents for a living.

00:12:51.044 --> 00:12:54.878
If it's sex you want,
the night is still young.

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:57.713
Please go to Asakusa or Shinagawa.

00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:02.356
Miss Ohatsu, thank you
so much for earlier...

00:13:02.456 --> 00:13:06.620
Don't worry about it.
You're a bit too submissive though.

00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:09.685
Your song...

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.000
It's just very moving.

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:19.765
Before I came here, I was selling
my body around Asakusa...

00:13:19.873 --> 00:13:21.432
...just like you.

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:26.973
Just once, I tried escaping
the red-light district with a lover.

00:13:27.614 --> 00:13:30.413
It was a shame
what happened to him.

00:13:31.718 --> 00:13:34.710
He was so heartbroken
he hung himself.

00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.156
We were both just too young.

00:13:41.662 --> 00:13:46.998
Even if you wish to live a decent life,
once you get mixed up in all this...

00:13:47.734 --> 00:13:54.401
...the heavens see, and they don't
let you get close to any other dreams.

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:02.879
If Father were alive
and did something like that...

00:14:03.317 --> 00:14:04.682
...I'd be angry.

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:10.480
If I had a brother,
and he did something like that...

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:13.022
...think I'd still be angry.

00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:18.663
You see, this has nothing
to do with jealousy.

00:14:25.672 --> 00:14:28.607
Could it be that you're still mad?

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.404
Get a life, Rin.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.708
| said I'm sorry for buying
a girl without telling you.

00:14:37.784 --> 00:14:41.448
Or maybe that's not it.
Maybe you're jealous.

00:14:41.855 --> 00:14:43.016
Are you...

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.217
...stupid or something?

00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:50.957
Just to let you know, Manji,
| don't care what you do.

00:14:51.832 --> 00:14:54.062
Yes, that's right. I don't care.

00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:58.362
You're a man, so I'm sure you
have your own share of troubles.

00:14:58.472 --> 00:15:03.501
| won't say you can't spend money on
a prostitute. But you're my bodyguard.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:08.207
If you're doing such things when the
time comes, that'd be a problem, right?

00:15:08.315 --> 00:15:12.718
If you want to play around, just go
out while I'm asleep so I don't notice.

00:15:12.819 --> 00:15:16.483
Okay, okay.
I'll watch out from now on.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:19.922
Please do so.

00:15:20.027 --> 00:15:23.588
Although, if you look
at this in a different light...

00:15:23.697 --> 00:15:27.531
...there's a way to resolve
this without spending money.

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:32.765
For example, if you
were to be my partner.

00:15:35.909 --> 00:15:40.073
Forget that. It'd never work
with a girl who's like sixteen.

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:45.681
Chances are you've been so busy
with sword training most of your life...

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:50.019
...that you've never even held hands
with any man besides your father.

00:15:59.433 --> 00:16:01.026
W-Well?

00:16:05.405 --> 00:16:07.874
Do I look more like an adult?

00:16:11.445 --> 00:16:13.345
What the heck was that?

00:16:15.382 --> 00:16:17.510
Sorry, sorry. What a joke!

00:16:17.617 --> 00:16:19.415
You're a funny girl!

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.889
You know, a kid like you doesn't
have the breasts or butt to look sexy...

00:16:24.992 --> 00:16:28.053
...just by letting down your hair.
If the world worked like...

00:16:31.598 --> 00:16:33.589
Get out of here! Now!

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.431
Damn it, stupid!
What are you doing?

00:16:36.536 --> 00:16:38.334
H-Hey, wait wait wait!

00:16:39.573 --> 00:16:43.168
Makie, there's someone out back
who wants to see you.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.848
What in the world
are you doing here?

00:16:56.123 --> 00:16:58.455
You think I ransomed you that day...

00:16:58.558 --> 00:17:02.017
...50 you could work
somewhere like this as a geisha?

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:07.267
| wanted to pay
you back the money...

00:17:07.367 --> 00:17:10.826
| don't recall asking you
to do such a thing.

00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:12.968
Excuse me.

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:17.302
| heard you fought with him.

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:19.045
Yes...

00:17:19.379 --> 00:17:22.178
He was a strong, ferocious fellow.

00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:27.554
I find it hard to believe...

00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:30.882
...but many of my men
have died by his hand.

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:37.361
Two of those men had
sword skills that threatened even me.

00:17:38.865 --> 00:17:42.563
Even so, he shouldn't
be much of a foe to you.

00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:48.868
It's my opinion that you're
the only one in the world...

00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:52.741
...who can defeat me with a sword.

00:17:57.551 --> 00:17:59.212
My mother...

00:18:00.787 --> 00:18:03.449
I've been thinking about my mother.

00:18:04.991 --> 00:18:10.054
She said if I would kill for a living...
If I would be a swordswoman...

00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:13.098
...| might as well just be a prostitute.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.828
But I'm just a joke.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:22.875
| don't even have the backbone
to be either one of those.

00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:31.109
I'm now a geisha so I can pay
you back as soon as possible...

00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:36.047
...but what will I do
if that comes to an end?

00:18:40.393 --> 00:18:42.725
If you tell me to wait, I will.

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:47.858
But someday...

00:18:49.236 --> 00:18:50.965
...I'll make you mine.

00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:08.086
If only I didn't know the true cruel
intentions behind those words...

00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:12.756
...then what bliss
| would feel right now.

00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:18.291
But, Sir Kagehisa...

00:19:18.398 --> 00:19:20.890
...I know it all too well.

00:19:21.468 --> 00:19:25.905
You just want my abilities.

00:19:28.241 --> 00:19:29.367
You are...

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.704
You are the same as my father.

00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:37.851
You would pluck away
at a mere woman's dream...

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:41.021
...if it furthered your ambition.

00:19:42.489 --> 00:19:46.517
Born into a samurai household
but not allowed to hold a sword...

00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:50.062
...or even hope for a modicum
of happiness in this world.

00:19:50.163 --> 00:19:52.632
| imagine that in your eyes...

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.761
...my life must look
like a despicable thing.

00:20:02.142 --> 00:20:04.770
But I...

00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:22.553
Why weren't you intimate
with me that time?

00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:27.091
Had I fallen into a twisted
lifestyle at your hands...

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.467
...| might have been able
to bring myself to live as a prostitute.

00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:41.673
| can't stand to see
your talent smothered like that.

00:20:42.782 --> 00:20:43.943
That's all.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.497
No wonder you wouldn't
stoop to my level.

00:21:03.603 --> 00:21:07.267
You've been treated like gold
by a handsome man like him.

00:21:07.874 --> 00:21:12.402
| was hired by your ex-boss
at the place you used to work.

00:21:13.046 --> 00:21:16.505
He said to bring you
back even if it's by force.

00:21:18.618 --> 00:21:20.108
| understand.

00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:25.056
| was acting like a child.

00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:35.000
| just now...

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:37.698
...realized it.

00:21:38.271 --> 00:21:42.572
Stupid bitch. Nobody'll wanna
buy you if you chop that off!

00:21:55.288 --> 00:21:56.983
Miss Ohatsu...

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.582
It was just like you said.

00:22:00.226 --> 00:22:03.389
Once a woman falls
into a life of whoring...

00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:09.697
...having dreams the way other people
do simply becomes too much to ask.

00:22:25.752 --> 00:22:31.657
Sadly, I awakened...

00:22:31.758 --> 00:22:39.597
Overflowing reality is just...

00:22:40.533 --> 00:22:45.596
...more of the empty lies.

00:22:49.642 --> 00:22:57.642
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:05.383
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:05.692 --> 00:23:12.962
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:16.330
| remember...

00:23:16.469 --> 00:23:22.806
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:29.212
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:37.349
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:52.867
Where should I go?

00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:56.742
Infinite Preview

00:24:08.254 --> 00:24:09.688
Dream Play
