WEBVTT

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.971
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:29.180
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:36.387
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:43.127
Is that who you want?

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:47.761
Is red not good enough?

00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:54.779
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:02.150
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:10.218
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:16.823
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:24.532
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.432
Saki, Renzo...

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:51.827
...I'm home.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.242
| guess this is what it is.

00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:08.342
Mask of Change

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.686
Festivals are great!

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.984
Yeah.

00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:17.158
There you go.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.229
Thanks.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.954
Manji!

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.062
Look, look. Come on, look.

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.839
Say something.

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:29.668
Like what?

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:35.646
"Oh, that's cute," or "Man, that makes
me want to whistle," or something.

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.808
It doesn't look good on you.

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:44.078
How much did that cost?

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.486
Forty mon.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.118
We agreed just fifty mon,
so you have ten mon left.

00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:53.027
This is how you're spending it?

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.931
Can't you buy that
somewhere besides a fair?

00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:59.333
Shut up, it's my choice.

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:01.873
Why are you mad?

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.374
What was that for?

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:11.883
Well, whatever.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.283
She's been moping around
the past two or three days.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.120
Hey, young lady.

00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:21.215
Want some tokoroten?

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.696
Good, huh?

00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:32.429
Yes, it is.

00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:33.868
Of course.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.176
Mother or Father used
to walk beside me...

00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:48.185
How many people have
died for your revenge?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.829
| have to stop thinking about it...

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.127
Sir, you look bored.

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:06.635
Yeah.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.339
That's a shame...

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:13.878
...since you have that young lady
with you, and you're at a festival.

00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:15.947
Festival, huh...

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:22.976
To me, this is like a scene you can't
grab hold of because it's underwater.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.985
Underwater?

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.694
No matter what I do...

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.520
...there's just no place for me.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.035
Gohei Mochi

00:04:37.636 --> 00:04:41.038
Guess I'll buy him some.
Though I doubt it'll make him happy.

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:45.370
Um, excuse me...

00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:46.842
I'll take five!

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:49.537
You're an energetic one, kid.

00:04:50.382 --> 00:04:52.680
I'll give you a deal, sixteen mon.

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:55.549
Really? You're a great guy!

00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:58.113
Oh, yeah?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.518
You ladykiller!

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:03.785
Make it fifteen, kid.

00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:07.456
Nice. Handsome guys
are a cut above. Thanks.

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:09.091
Hold on, young man.

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:10.293
What is it?

00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:17.533
In the world of adults, what you
just did is called cutting in line.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.635
Don't treat me like a kid.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.078
It's your fault for not
speaking up louder.

00:05:24.182 --> 00:05:28.016
You expect a lady to raise her voice?

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.254
You're doing it now.

00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:37.621
I think guys who can't apologize
at times like this aren't very manly.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.391
So what? I'm still a kid.

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:46.398
Okay, I'll let you go this time.

00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:49.871
Excuse me! Can I get two please?

00:05:50.575 --> 00:05:52.134
That's eight mon.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.301
Thank you.

00:05:56.047 --> 00:05:58.482
Are you... gonna eat that?

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:00.415
It's yours if you're that hungry.

00:06:03.421 --> 00:06:04.718
What's this?

00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:08.188
Hey, mask maker, sell this to me.

00:06:08.293 --> 00:06:10.785
Could you hold on a minute, sir?

00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:14.325
I'm a little busy right now.

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:17.799
Which one of you is younger?

00:06:17.903 --> 00:06:18.768
Why?

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.765
I've only got one tengu mask.

00:06:21.873 --> 00:06:25.366
It'd probably speed things up
if you just fight over it...

00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:28.276
...but the mask might
break in the process.

00:06:29.047 --> 00:06:32.608
No matter who wins,
the damage will be done between you.

00:06:32.717 --> 00:06:36.017
You have to avoid that
if you don't want to lose anything.

00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:41.582
Okay, then this belongs to you, miss.

00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:43.819
Thank you.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.457
You're a good guy, kid.

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:53.737
Oh, don't tell me
| praised you for nothing.

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:59.066
Here, I'll let you
have this one for free.

00:06:59.177 --> 00:07:01.077
| don't want it...

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.273
What's wrong with it?

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.873
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth...

00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:11.890
Sir, may I borrow
your sword for a moment?

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:15.620
Please.

00:07:55.367 --> 00:07:57.995
Here, how is it now?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.237
It's weird.

00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:05.109
| guess it's just lost on kids.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.907
Oh, well.

00:08:08.847 --> 00:08:10.406
Can| have it?

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:12.677
Can| have that?

00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:15.276
Thank you!

00:08:16.388 --> 00:08:18.117
That was something else.

00:08:18.223 --> 00:08:20.658
Thanks... And thanks for waiting.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.750
You're done with that now, right?

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:31.601
This has tasted a pretty
good amount of blood.

00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:35.796
What, you counted the number
of stains or something?

00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:38.137
Let's just say I did.

00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:40.473
This sword is amazing...

00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:44.671
It's killed a hundred... No, more...

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:47.115
And just this year alone...

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:49.583
...about ten.

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:53.348
Is that about right?

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.186
Can I ask one thing?

00:08:56.294 --> 00:08:59.355
How do you Itto-ryu guys...

00:08:59.464 --> 00:09:03.401
...always manage to get
where we're going before we do?

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.402
Are there strings attached
to our asses or something?

00:09:07.605 --> 00:09:11.132
Sir, you've got it all wrong.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:15.541
Nobody in the Itto-ryu
is bored enough...

00:09:16.448 --> 00:09:19.679
...to watch over every
single place you go.

00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:23.812
As you can see,
we aren't usually together.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:27.882
All we've been told
about you guys is...

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.758
..."If you see them, kill them."

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.356
That's all.

00:09:46.578 --> 00:09:47.807
Dad!

00:09:48.513 --> 00:09:49.708
Renzo!

00:09:49.814 --> 00:09:52.283
What... are you doing?

00:09:55.186 --> 00:09:57.678
Sir, sorry about that...

00:09:58.323 --> 00:09:59.882
I'm returning this.

00:10:03.328 --> 00:10:05.990
Don't worry. It's nothing important.

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:12.134
He made a comment about my craft...

00:10:12.804 --> 00:10:15.273
...and I let it go to my head.

00:10:17.642 --> 00:10:19.235
I'm sorry, sir.

00:10:19.644 --> 00:10:21.738
I'm a little short-fused.

00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:22.972
It's fine...

00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:25.540
Did you buy the mochi?

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.109
Then let's go
dedicate it at the grave.

00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:31.914
Ah, yes, sir...

00:10:32.023 --> 00:10:34.993
Please take one you like.

00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:38.927
If you understand the beauty
of Kawakami Araya's masks...

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.727
...then you're quite
the eccentric yourself.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.604
| found him...

00:10:55.813 --> 00:10:58.544
Kawakami Ara ya.

00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:00.951
Infinity.

00:11:02.086 --> 00:11:02.951
Infinity.

00:11:18.203 --> 00:11:19.193
Still awake?

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:23.268
Yeah...

00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:25.706
Today, that guy...

00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:28.606
Could it be he's...

00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:29.771
Maniji...

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.215
Never mind.

00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:57.505
It's kind of lonely after a festival...

00:11:58.476 --> 00:11:59.375
Anyway...

00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:03.539
Hey, kid, why can't you apologize?

00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:08.745
You cut my sandal thong, and
you won't even say you're sorry?

00:12:09.387 --> 00:12:12.357
You kicked the bamboo
yourself, and it ripped!

00:12:14.425 --> 00:12:17.554
If you saw someone wander
around with those eyesores...

00:12:17.662 --> 00:12:20.597
...| bet you'd want
to kick them too, idiot.

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:22.610
Apologize.

00:12:22.634 --> 00:12:23.624
Apologize.
No!

00:12:23.735 --> 00:12:25.032
Oh, yeah?

00:12:25.803 --> 00:12:28.272
I'm in a bad mood today.

00:12:28.906 --> 00:12:31.375
What do you want cut off? Your ear?

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.078
Okay, ear it is.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.911
Stop!

00:12:40.518 --> 00:12:41.849
It's you...

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:43.987
Who the hell are you?

00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:50.920
Good sir, he is one of my relatives.

00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:53.860
He is very young and ill-mannered...

00:12:53.965 --> 00:12:57.799
...50 I would appreciate it if you
could please overlook his rudeness.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.829
Should you kill a child
over a small incident like this...

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.433
...| suspect it will only result
in a blemish on your name.

00:13:06.544 --> 00:13:07.511
Please.

00:13:08.813 --> 00:13:13.046
You sure have good
manners for a small-town girl.

00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:17.383
Despite appearances,
| am the heiress of a town dojo.

00:13:17.488 --> 00:13:19.547
Heiress? Which one?

00:13:19.657 --> 00:13:23.560
The Mutenichi-ryu
main household, the Asano Dojo.

00:13:24.228 --> 00:13:26.856
Asano? You know that one?

00:13:26.964 --> 00:13:28.295
Asano...

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:31.266
Oh, right. You know, that one...

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.798
Ah, that one!

00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:40.806
Asano, huh? You mean that Asano!

00:13:41.512 --> 00:13:44.914
He died like two
years ago, didn't he?

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:49.817
The guy those Itto-ryu guys killed
off so easily. You're his daughter!

00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:55.891
Why're you wandering
around here alone? You homeless?

00:13:56.427 --> 00:14:01.695
That's no good.
You'd be better off as a prostitute.

00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:05.325
Then you'd be able
to show your face in public.

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:06.699
Why you!

00:14:08.272 --> 00:14:09.398
Be quiet.

00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:10.565
But...

00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:13.372
I'm sorry for
the ongoing discourtesy.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:18.541
Well, I guess it's fine. If you're
saying you'll take the fall for the kid...

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:20.380
...fix it.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:22.429
Yes, sir.

00:14:22.453 --> 00:14:24.251
Yes, sir.
Don't do it!

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.386
Hey, what are you doing?

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.127
Just a moment.

00:14:31.062 --> 00:14:34.794
Uh-oh. At this rate,
my foot's gonna get dirty.

00:14:35.466 --> 00:14:36.831
That's better.

00:15:06.798 --> 00:15:07.765
Sir!

00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:12.398
It's done.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.475
It's better than before it ripped.

00:15:18.576 --> 00:15:19.543
Thank you.

00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:22.714
Well, kid? Now do you get it?

00:15:22.814 --> 00:15:27.251
A person's attitude can keep him
from getting hurt for no reason.

00:15:27.618 --> 00:15:30.144
Isn't that right, loser's daughter?

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.749
Why don't you talk back to them?

00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:37.590
I'm thankful you saved me...

00:15:41.432 --> 00:15:44.231
...but aren't you
the daughter of a swordsman?

00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:46.046
Why'd you do something like that?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.080
Why'd you do something like that?
Because today I'm unarmed, and...

00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:49.163
Because today I'm unarmed, and...

00:15:53.377 --> 00:15:55.903
..."I have to stay calm."

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:01.809
A parent never looks bigger
than in their own child's eyes.

00:16:02.854 --> 00:16:05.482
| guess this is what they mean.

00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:08.818
Your parents were killed...

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:10.928
Yes.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.596
By members of the Itto-ryu.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.134
Ittoryu...

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:18.396
That's right.

00:16:18.503 --> 00:16:20.437
What's the Itto-ryu?

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.668
Did you just ask what...

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:27.039
You really don't know?

00:16:27.144 --> 00:16:28.111
Yeah...

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:31.942
Anyway, you should
come by my place.

00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:34.677
| can at least fix you some tea.

00:16:37.154 --> 00:16:38.315
What's wrong?

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.416
Um, well... It's nothing.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.927
Then let's go. This way.

00:16:46.898 --> 00:16:49.924
I'm going to see Kawakami Ara ya...

00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:55.101
That idiot.

00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:58.418
She's not even carrying a sword...

00:16:58.442 --> 00:17:03.141
I've put myself
in the hands of a demon.

00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:32.600
No, please don't!

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.138
Mother...

00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:40.413
Destroy her.

00:17:41.385 --> 00:17:43.046
Hurry up, Dad!

00:17:43.754 --> 00:17:45.518
She's been waiting!

00:17:45.623 --> 00:17:47.887
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:17:47.992 --> 00:17:50.324
No, you don't. You're being slow.

00:17:50.428 --> 00:17:51.738
Yeah, I said I know!

00:17:51.762 --> 00:17:53.628
Yeah, I said I know!
Calm down...

00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:57.599
Okay, fine, but can't you
do something about those clothes?

00:17:58.269 --> 00:17:59.446
Are they that dirty?

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.960
Are they that dirty?
Hey...

00:18:01.072 --> 00:18:01.748
This isn't a drinking buddy.

00:18:01.772 --> 00:18:03.672
This isn't a drinking buddy.
Calm down...

00:18:03.774 --> 00:18:06.539
You have to keep
in mind that she's a lady.

00:18:06.644 --> 00:18:08.908
That's easy for you to say.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.713
| left my sword behind, and he
didn't see my face yesterday.

00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:17.914
| don't look the way I did
two years ago. He won't know.

00:18:27.198 --> 00:18:29.690
You've already put out refreshments.

00:18:30.434 --> 00:18:34.166
You hardly ever serve tea to a guest.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:35.903
I'm impressed.

00:18:37.174 --> 00:18:40.405
Shut up. You didn't have to say that.

00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:43.912
I'll clean up downstairs.

00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:47.577
She's our special guest,
so you'd better not be careless.

00:18:47.685 --> 00:18:48.652
Sure...

00:18:52.857 --> 00:18:55.519
Ah, excuse me.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.260
Not at all. Excuse me as well.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.662
The man selling masks around here?

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.566
You mean Kawakami.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.765
Yeah, him. How do I find him?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.333
Let's see...

00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:12.499
What now?

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.773
No sense in telling
him for free. Let's charge him.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.678
Doesn't look like he's got much.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:21.275
Then why not get him
to take down the stall behind us?

00:19:21.385 --> 00:19:22.648
Oh, yeah.

00:19:22.753 --> 00:19:24.448
That would be great.

00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:26.489
Let's do that then.

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:35.830
Like that?

00:19:36.834 --> 00:19:37.926
Sure...

00:19:39.437 --> 00:19:42.429
| can't thank you enough.

00:19:42.907 --> 00:19:45.399
You saved
a complete stranger's son...

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:48.774
...when your own life
could have been endangered.

00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:52.907
If you don't mind,
could you tell me where you live?

00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:56.180
I'd like to come
and formally thank you again.

00:19:57.054 --> 00:20:00.183
No, you needn't
concern yourself further.

00:20:01.892 --> 00:20:03.155
I'm sorry.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.958
I'm not too good with
etiquette in situations like this...

00:20:11.368 --> 00:20:14.668
No. I didn't come here
to talk about these things.

00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:24.274
Had I been there, you wouldn't
have had to be humiliated...

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:29.043
| used to wield
a sword back in the day.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.915
A sword...

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.079
Yes.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.485
My comrades and I used
to run wild quite a bit...

00:20:36.594 --> 00:20:39.825
I'm not proud to admit it...

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:44.225
...but my wife took my kid
and ran off because of it.

00:20:44.335 --> 00:20:49.364
Although about a year ago,
she died of an illness...

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:53.037
Renzo was the only one
who came back to me.

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:57.503
That's when I had this weird feeling...

00:20:57.748 --> 00:21:01.309
If a parent always gets
himself into dangerous business...

00:21:01.418 --> 00:21:05.446
...then his kid might just
turn out the same way.

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:13.063
That's when I decided
to make the next job my last one...

00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:16.494
Once that was done...

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.060
...| figured it might be nice to earn
a simple living working with kids.

00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:31.445
Young lady, are your
parents in good health?

00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:41.082
Well...

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:44.686
Both of them are already...

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.325
I'm sorry about that...

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:53.199
It's in the past,
so it doesn't bother me anymore.

00:21:54.138 --> 00:21:56.573
If you want to know the truth...

00:21:58.075 --> 00:22:02.205
...they were murdered by strangers.

00:22:02.813 --> 00:22:04.212
Really...

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:11.112
Will you listen to what I have to say?
In fact, I'd be quite relieved if you did.

00:22:11.222 --> 00:22:15.216
It's too weighty a thing
for me to bear by myself.

00:22:16.393 --> 00:22:19.954
I'm sure it is, so please tell me.

00:22:22.566 --> 00:22:23.965
If I'll do.

00:22:24.568 --> 00:22:25.694
Thank you.

00:22:27.438 --> 00:22:30.897
| still remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:22:33.077 --> 00:22:34.476
Every moment.

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:53.892
It was two years ago.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:23:01.404
Sadly, I awakened...

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:09.378
Overflowing reality is just...

00:23:10.281 --> 00:23:15.344
...more of the empty lies.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:27.390
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:23:29.066 --> 00:23:34.800
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:35.439 --> 00:23:42.709
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.080
| remember...

00:23:46.183 --> 00:23:52.281
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:52.656 --> 00:23:58.754
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:59.096 --> 00:24:07.096
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:24:19.883 --> 00:24:22.750
Where should I go?

00:24:24.989 --> 00:24:26.354
Infinite Preview

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:39.369
Wings
