WEBVTT

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:22.033
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:29.238
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:36.447
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:43.187
Is that who you want?

00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:47.800
Is red not good enough?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.829
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:54.941 --> 00:01:02.246
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:10.348
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:16.895
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.593
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:41.409
Anotsu Kagehisa...

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.694
You killed my dad...

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.165
Hey, Rin.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.008
Why are you just staring into space?

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:12.194
Wheel

00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:12.828
Yukimachi

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:14.684
Yukimachi
I told you to quit it.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.257
Well, I won't! Tai, you haven't
taken a bath in so long!

00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:21.759
Stuff will crawl
on you if you're not clean.

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:24.330
I'll do it myself, so give that here.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.092
The wounded should
just follow directions.

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.003
Do you want me to come back?

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:42.982
No, that's okay.

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:46.946
You seem better.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:48.145
Kind of.

00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:52.449
But I heal pretty slowly compared
to the Hundred-man Slayer.

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.317
The Hundred-man Slayer...

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.656
Did something happen?

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.733
Is it about that Akagi thing?

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:05.866
No, it's not about that.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.239
Then what is it?

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:15.008
Well, that's fine
if you don't want to say it.

00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:19.015
You just seem a little
different than usual today.

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:22.111
Do I seem that way?

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:26.920
I'm in no position to have any
say now that I've left the Itto-ryu...

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.860
...but how can I put it, y'know?

00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:36.457
I'm here to visit the injured,
and you worry about me instead.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.594
| guess I'm slipping.

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:42.803
| wish Tai would talk
to me that way too.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.478
Um, are you leaving?

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.546
Yes.

00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:52.977
If something is bothering you...

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.384
...you could always hide in the hills
and swing your sword around.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.685
You're right.

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.621
That may be the best idea.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.790
The best thing to do when you feel
depressed is to move your body.

00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:11.996
| was thinking about
training you some anyway.

00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:13.504
Yes, sir!

00:04:13.873 --> 00:04:16.137
Good answer at least.

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:20.008
But we can do sword
training at my dojo.

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:24.413
Why do we have to go
all the way back to your place?

00:04:24.517 --> 00:04:26.212
Because I see them.

00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:27.649
See them?

00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:29.254
Yeah.

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:31.320
Spirits.

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:32.890
Spirits?

00:04:32.992 --> 00:04:34.118
Yeah.

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:38.720
Your dojo's swarming with
the spirits of its murdered students.

00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:42.459
| can't train you
in such a gloomy place.

00:04:42.568 --> 00:04:45.003
Is that true?

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:50.472
Special attack!

00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:52.305
Golden Wasps!

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:54.771
Three hits!

00:04:55.848 --> 00:04:57.338
That's all?

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.179
See for yourself.

00:04:59.652 --> 00:05:03.782
Rin, this tree's about as wide
as a person's shoulders.

00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:06.821
You hit with three out of twelve.

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:09.827
Two of those three hit the torso.

00:05:11.497 --> 00:05:15.331
If the target was as big as
Kuroi Sabato, that'd probably work...

00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:20.031
...but beating a typical guy with that
accuracy would be a total gamble.

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:25.442
| just happened to mess up this time.
It really does well, when it hits.

00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:33.142
Look, this isn't the same as
swinging a wooden sword in a dojo.

00:05:33.252 --> 00:05:36.654
You can't get away with
"I messed up," stupid.

00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:39.053
These fights are to the death.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.538
Now you're a corpse.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.269
Guess how you scored.
Terribly, that's how.

00:06:01.714 --> 00:06:04.809
Maybe you'd manage
against a third-rate opponent...

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:08.376
...but if it's an Itto-ryu guy,
you'd be better off running.

00:06:12.024 --> 00:06:15.153
Stop crying over
every little thing, kid.

00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:20.393
The first thing to learn in swordplay
is to know your own weakness.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.125
Y-Yes, sir...

00:06:24.003 --> 00:06:27.496
If you have time to cry,
do some practice swings.

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:31.236
Moping around like this wastes
more time than anything else.

00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:35.314
We'll continue this after we eat.

00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:41.180
Maniji...

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.250
We ate together here
like this the first time we met.

00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:50.028
Yeah.

00:06:50.963 --> 00:06:54.422
When Yaobikuni
suggested I hire a bodyguard...

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.698
...I immediately
thought it was a good idea.

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:02.633
It's true that I was lonely...

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:06.939
But the truth was I thought
if I was with someone like that...

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:09.674
...maybe I could become strong too.

00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:14.943
Maybe I don't have the talent.

00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:22.359
Back in the day, the students taught
me forms using wooden swords...

00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:27.331
...and after Father died, I swung swords
around alone every day at the dojo.

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:32.070
I've been watching
you fight a lot recently...

00:07:33.772 --> 00:07:37.402
...but it's not really going
the way I thought it would go.

00:07:38.143 --> 00:07:39.770
Are you kidding me?

00:07:42.548 --> 00:07:47.042
It's one thing if you were fighting
every day till you puked blood...

00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:50.918
...but what's so special about
learning forms from mere students...

00:07:51.023 --> 00:07:55.984
...and swinging a sword at an invisible
opponent on a flat and empty floor?

00:07:56.095 --> 00:08:00.555
It'd sure be easy to become strong if
all you needed was a room somewhere.

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:04.562
In two years time,
I killed a hundred samurai.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.040
I've been in plenty of real fights...

00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:13.038
...and I honestly only barely manage
to win when [ fight the Itto-ryu.

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:19.241
Training in a dojo isn't
going to do jack shit for you.

00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:22.048
That's why it's here
instead of the dojo?

00:08:22.154 --> 00:08:26.921
Only those who've done what they
needed to do get to talk about "talent."

00:08:27.026 --> 00:08:28.824
Don't make me laugh.

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:31.659
Is he trying to cheer me up?

00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:34.663
Could that be?

00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:47.435
He shouldn't wake up for a while.

00:08:48.314 --> 00:08:52.979
It's nice to train away from
civilization, but I'm still a girl after all.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.154
Manji?

00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:39.025
There's somebody doing
the same thing as us...

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.140
Incredible, he hasn't missed a single
leaf within range of his weapon.

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:53.212
He's also looking
straight ahead the whole time.

00:09:58.283 --> 00:10:00.411
| admire him in a way.

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:05.222
| wonder if I have to become
like that someday. But...

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:24.500
Who's there? If you're a swordsman,
come out and name yourself.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.908
We'll see how good you are.

00:10:27.012 --> 00:10:29.481
Damn it... Damn it...

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:33.712
| have 24 Golden Wasps
in all. I can attack twice.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.022
But from this distance,
he'll see me before I throw them.

00:10:38.457 --> 00:10:40.391
It'd be a total gamble.

00:10:40.492 --> 00:10:45.020
I-I... can't just have
Manji protect me all the time.

00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:49.234
Am I hearing things?

00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:50.928
No...

00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:55.774
Golden Wasps!

00:10:56.909 --> 00:10:58.399
I hit him!

00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:13.023
Do you wish to die, little girl?

00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:18.028
He's going to kill me...

00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:20.031
Infinity.

00:11:21.099 --> 00:11:22.032
Infinity.

00:11:22.434 --> 00:11:25.768
Don't tell me those
were your only weapons.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.432
You shouldn't underestimate
an enemy this badly.

00:11:33.512 --> 00:11:36.106
I'm a swordswoman too, sort of...

00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:38.912
And you underestimated
me even worse...

00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:41.850
...by leaving this weapon
lying around like this!

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.955
No way...
He was swinging it so easily before...

00:12:00.239 --> 00:12:03.903
I'm sorry, Maniji... I'm such an idiot...

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.001
| seriously thought
| could defeat him...

00:12:07.246 --> 00:12:09.715
...even though I'm all by myself.

00:12:19.124 --> 00:12:20.558
It's you.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.065
| never expected Asano's daughter
to demonstrate such surprising growth.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.870
However, your technique
is downright insipid.

00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:42.277
As it stands, it can
only be used to intimidate.

00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:45.976
You're looking away from
the enemy just before you release.

00:12:56.028 --> 00:12:57.272
Why are you crying?

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:59.355
Why are you crying?
Because I'm frustrated of course!

00:12:59.464 --> 00:13:04.800
The man I want to kill is right in front
of me, but I can't do a damn thing!

00:13:04.903 --> 00:13:08.464
So what will you do now?
Strip and rape me?

00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:11.198
What if I did?

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.369
I'd bite my tongue off.

00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:16.611
What if I was going
to kill you right away?

00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:21.084
That would be better.
Why not hurry and get it over with?

00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:27.515
What I don't understand...

00:13:27.626 --> 00:13:31.585
...Is the attitude you people
have of rushing towards death.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.697
Is that the "way of the samurai"?

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:40.303
Say what you want...

00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:43.898
I'm not a samurai.
First of all, I'm a woman...

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:48.708
| only took up the sword because
| wanted revenge for my parents.

00:13:49.448 --> 00:13:52.418
Then why aren't
you begging for your life?

00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:58.079
If you get out of here alive,
you'll have another chance to kill me.

00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.085
What are you saying?

00:14:01.627 --> 00:14:02.992
What the hell?

00:14:03.095 --> 00:14:06.429
You killed my father
like it was nothing, you know!

00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:11.162
Are you pitying me because
I'm still a kid? Well, think again!

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:13.503
No.

00:14:13.572 --> 00:14:15.563
What do you mean, "No"?

00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:27.646
Your thoughts?

00:14:27.753 --> 00:14:31.383
It's a weird axe.
Isn't a Japanese sword easier to use?

00:14:33.925 --> 00:14:35.689
It certainly is.

00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:37.888
For tight turns and sharpness...

00:14:37.996 --> 00:14:40.966
...perhaps nothing
surpasses Japanese swords.

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:42.123
But...

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:45.528
...you don't control this via power.

00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:49.130
If you add to the axe's
downward momentum just a little...

00:14:50.909 --> 00:14:54.641
...then even my strength
is enough to control it.

00:14:59.217 --> 00:15:04.121
Even if an opponent reads
my moves in an actual battle...

00:15:04.222 --> 00:15:09.626
...it's possible to shatter their blocked
sword and their skull with this axe.

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:14.527
My grandfather was
expelled from the Mutenichi-ryu...

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:17.432
...simply for using a foreign sword.

00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:22.133
| brandish a weapon like this
to prove his actions were just.

00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:27.139
I killed your father to settle
the score for my grandfather.

00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:28.644
At first, anyway.

00:15:29.281 --> 00:15:32.649
But even if that
situation hadn't existed...

00:15:33.552 --> 00:15:39.252
...I would've thought it best to do away
with people like your father anyway.

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:43.488
I'm not going to kill you here.

00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:48.624
...but chances are one of my
followers will eventually kill both of you.

00:15:48.734 --> 00:15:52.500
If you don't want to die,
don't get involved with me any further.

00:15:53.572 --> 00:15:54.562
Why...

00:15:55.173 --> 00:15:57.904
Why do you hate
my father so much?

00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:00.842
Do you hold a grudge
over something he did?

00:16:00.946 --> 00:16:02.914
It's not a grudge.

00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:07.180
It's a cross-examination
as a swordsman.

00:16:07.285 --> 00:16:09.379
Cross-examination?

00:16:09.588 --> 00:16:11.113
W-Wait, hold on!

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.025
| have the right to ask. Don't I?

00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:19.431
Do you wish every day
to become strong?

00:16:20.565 --> 00:16:21.896
Y-Yes.

00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:25.898
You came up with that
ridiculous move for that reason?

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:28.564
I'm sorry you think it's ridiculous.

00:16:31.743 --> 00:16:34.235
It was 300 years ago...

00:16:35.113 --> 00:16:39.482
Oda Nobunaga brought our
country its first 3,000 firearms...

00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:44.681
...at Shitaragahara in Mikawa,
and he defeated Takeda's cavalry.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:51.085
Fifty years later, during
the Kan'ei era. Miyamoto Musashi...

00:16:51.196 --> 00:16:55.429
...abandoned the conviction that
swords should be used one at a time...

00:16:55.534 --> 00:16:57.593
...fought with a sword in each hand...

00:16:57.702 --> 00:17:01.161
...and became the founder
of the dual-sword technique.

00:17:02.574 --> 00:17:05.874
Do any point at these two
and call them cowards?

00:17:06.444 --> 00:17:08.913
It's the same as you right now.

00:17:09.014 --> 00:17:11.915
It's a matter of thinking
of a way to achieve...

00:17:12.017 --> 00:17:15.476
...the very natural motive
of victory over one's enemy.

00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:19.555
If this were cowardice...

00:17:19.658 --> 00:17:24.994
...then it's also cowardice for cavalry
to stab foot soldiers with their spears.

00:17:25.096 --> 00:17:26.564
Am I wrong?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.158
| don't think so...

00:17:30.402 --> 00:17:35.704
| believe only those who taxed
their ingenuity to become stronger...

00:17:35.807 --> 00:17:40.267
...should be called excellent military
commanders and swordsmen.

00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:47.316
These are peaceful times, but sword
schools keep growing in number.

00:17:47.419 --> 00:17:51.356
However, this has nothing
to do with the sword's prosperity.

00:17:53.925 --> 00:17:57.555
Their schools mean nothing
more than a mere occupation.

00:17:57.662 --> 00:18:01.098
They allow daimyo and
feudal retainers to hold a shinai...

00:18:01.199 --> 00:18:05.898
...teach them forms, and receive
praise and registration fees at best.

00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:08.336
That's why they exist.

00:18:11.409 --> 00:18:15.607
To what end they use their
own swords is perhaps up to them.

00:18:16.348 --> 00:18:22.219
But whenever I think about it, a certain
anxiety runs through my heart.

00:18:23.755 --> 00:18:25.086
If we...

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.158
If the Itto-ryu fight one on one...

00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:37.502
...it doesn't matter what
weapon or techniques we use.

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:40.972
It's a school, yet not a school.

00:18:41.606 --> 00:18:43.438
Your father was wrapped up...

00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:47.444
...in a bushido of nothing but
form, appearance, and lip service.

00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:51.573
We won't lose sight of our
duty as warriors as he did.

00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:57.612
I'll stake my lifetime on tearing down
the walls of all the different schools.

00:18:58.356 --> 00:18:59.255
Until then...

00:19:01.226 --> 00:19:06.756
...I don't care at all
if they brand me a demon.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.470
There's hardly a day
when you'll find me sitting in a dojo.

00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:31.980
If you miss this chance, it'll likely
be some time before we meet again.

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:35.515
These are yours.

00:19:36.261 --> 00:19:38.457
Do as you like with them.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.166
Um...

00:19:50.675 --> 00:19:54.134
Please...
Please answer one thing for me.

00:19:56.047 --> 00:19:59.108
Why are you letting me live?

00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:05.018
| am a member of the Mutenichi-ryu
too, just like my father was.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.027
I'm trying to kill you,
and you know it...

00:20:14.432 --> 00:20:18.528
Your eyes are looking in
a different direction than your father.

00:20:20.972 --> 00:20:25.603
If the technique you used earlier
was judged by Mutenichi-ryu rules...

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.941
...it would unquestionably
be deemed heterodox.

00:20:29.047 --> 00:20:31.106
You should know that.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:37.052
But you chose to walk such
a path in order to surpass me.

00:20:38.923 --> 00:20:41.324
You are a bold woman.

00:20:42.994 --> 00:20:46.430
You're no longer part
of the Mutenichi-ryu.

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:51.558
You're on your way
to becoming just like us.

00:20:59.344 --> 00:21:00.505
Goodbye.

00:21:00.612 --> 00:21:02.842
Keep devoting yourself to it.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.475
N-No...

00:21:37.248 --> 00:21:38.409
So...

00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:43.548
So what are you telling me to do?

00:21:49.094 --> 00:21:50.255
Damn it...

00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:14.914
Father...

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:31.435
Sadly, I awakened...

00:22:31.536 --> 00:22:39.535
Overflowing reality is just...

00:22:40.311 --> 00:22:45.374
...more of the empty lies.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:57.420
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:22:59.097 --> 00:23:05.161
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:12.740
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:12.844 --> 00:23:16.109
| remember...

00:23:16.214 --> 00:23:22.586
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:22.687 --> 00:23:28.990
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:29.093 --> 00:23:37.093
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:23:49.914 --> 00:23:52.679
Where should I go?

00:23:55.086 --> 00:23:56.520
Infinite Preview

00:24:08.032 --> 00:24:09.466
Wind
