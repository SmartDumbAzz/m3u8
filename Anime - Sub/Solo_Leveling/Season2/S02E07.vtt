00:10.740 --> 00:12.160
Hey, look!

00:12.160 --> 00:14.040
It's Baek Yoonho
from the White Tiger Guild.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.410
Choi Jong-In from
the Hunters Guild is also here.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.290
Why are there so many people?

00:19.290 --> 00:21.630
What is happening today?

00:21.630 --> 00:24.930
Are you both here to recruit Lee Minsung?

00:24.930 --> 00:26.460
- Minsung? Who is that?
- Will Lee Minsung retire

00:26.460 --> 00:27.470
- Minsung? Who is that?
- from the entertainment industry?

00:27.470 --> 00:30.300
- I'm not here for that.
- Could you share your thoughts?

00:30.300 --> 00:34.680
I know Lee Minsung has signed
with the Fiend Guild,

00:34.680 --> 00:36.520
but I'm here for something else.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.890
What?

00:37.890 --> 00:39.350
I thought there'd be some big news.

00:39.820 --> 00:41.840
What a waste of time.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.560
I've heard the story.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.490
The A-Rank dungeon that nearly reached
S-Rank caused you a lot of trouble.

00:47.490 --> 00:48.570
Well...

00:48.570 --> 00:53.460
Not as bad as how the White Tiger Guild
let A-Rank rookies die in the Red Gate.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.200
I heard you almost had
to ask us for help.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.000
But he didn't let it turn out like that.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.420
To repay him,

01:02.420 --> 01:05.500
our Hunters Guild must give him
a grand welcome.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.550
Nonsense, he also helped us.

01:08.550 --> 01:10.760
Plus, we had casualties.

01:13.690 --> 01:15.930
Are you trying to recruit
another S-Rank Hunter?

01:15.930 --> 01:18.140
Are you trying to start a war?

01:18.140 --> 01:21.890
I'm asking you the exact same thing.

01:23.730 --> 01:24.360
Oh?

01:24.360 --> 01:26.820
Are you Jong-In and Yoonho?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.110
Hello.

01:28.110 --> 01:31.450
Are you fighting over our Lee Minsung?

01:31.450 --> 01:35.200
Be it Lee Minsung or Lee Minho,
I'm not interested!

01:36.250 --> 01:38.640
You two are sharing one mind.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.460
Today is the day for my re-evaluation.

01:41.910 --> 01:43.210
But what's with this fuss?

01:52.720 --> 01:56.470
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

03:14.700 --> 03:17.050
Look, it's Minsung's press conference.

03:17.050 --> 03:18.760
- That actor?
- Next, we will live-stream

03:18.760 --> 03:21.220
- I've heard he has an indecent private life.
- the press conference.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.180
- He had affairs with women he worked with.
- What are they talking about?

03:23.180 --> 03:25.020
- Is it an apology press conference?
- I'm not interested.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.600
Thank you all for gathering here today.

03:29.010 --> 03:30.570
As everyone knows,

03:30.570 --> 03:33.970
I, Lee Minsung, have awakened
the power of a Hunter.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.820
In a moment, I will go in
for my rank assessment.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.240
Since the day I awakened,
I've been worrying endlessly.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.290
But I've made up my mind.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.730
I will fulfill the mission given to me.

03:45.260 --> 03:51.130
I will fight under the leadership of
the Fiend Guild's master, Lim Tae-Gyu.

03:51.490 --> 03:54.200
Does it mean you are retiring
from the entertainment industry?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.220
Without even knowing your assessment results?

03:56.220 --> 03:58.010
Are you going to be fully a Hunter?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.750
Of course not.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.000
I got an A-Rank rating a long time ago.

04:03.430 --> 04:06.930
The contract with the Fiend Guild
is for two years.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.940
I'll just be a Hunter during this time.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.730
Until all the scandals are forgotten,

04:11.730 --> 04:14.070
I will then return to the entertainment industry

04:14.070 --> 04:16.190
with the achievements of
an A-Rank Hunter.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.780
No matter what rank I am at,

04:18.780 --> 04:20.620
I will risk my life to fight the magicâ€”

04:20.620 --> 04:21.780
Hey!

04:22.330 --> 04:24.310
We're still holding a press conference!

04:24.310 --> 04:26.000
Step aside, don't block the camera!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.330
No, I need to go to the association.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.710
Wait till later!

04:29.710 --> 04:32.080
How can there be someone so oblivious?

04:32.590 --> 04:35.050
No access here! Move aside...

04:35.050 --> 04:38.000
It would be very inconvenient for me
if you blocked the road.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.890
C-Chairman Go?!

04:41.480 --> 04:44.260
That gentleman is my guest.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.270
Didn't we request you to not hold
a press conference at this hour?

04:49.270 --> 04:50.350
Ah...

04:50.350 --> 04:53.110
- Please come in, Hunter Sung.
- This way, the scandal can be...

04:56.650 --> 04:58.570
- He messed up my event!
- Does anyone know who that man is?

04:59.150 --> 05:00.650
Sorry, everyone.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.530
I'll go and check again.

05:05.190 --> 05:08.750
There are others currently
undergoing re-evaluation.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.170
No entry until it's done.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.920
Hey, do you know who I am?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.960
Just one word from me
and you'll lose your job.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.920
I don't know who you are.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.180
But if you're here to cause trouble,

05:22.620 --> 05:25.010
that's not a very wise decision.

05:29.810 --> 05:33.770
They are here waiting for today's results.

05:34.730 --> 05:39.480
They must be eager to know the strength
of a new S-Rank Hunter after two years.

05:44.660 --> 05:46.330
Before the re-evaluation,

05:46.330 --> 05:49.240
we need to verify your
Hunter ability system.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.500
What kind of ability
can you use, Hunter Sung?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.680
I can do this.

05:58.070 --> 06:01.050
Is this summoning?

06:01.050 --> 06:03.800
So you can use summoning magic, right?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.310
Well... Sort of.

06:06.310 --> 06:07.530
Hunter Sung.

06:08.010 --> 06:11.180
I have seen the report
submitted by Chief Woo.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.980
You can do more than that, right?

06:14.380 --> 06:15.900
I guess so.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.470
They've seen everything.

06:23.740 --> 06:26.740
I can summon about a hundred more.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.660
A... A hundred?!

06:28.660 --> 06:30.240
It's really unbelievable!

06:32.060 --> 06:34.080
Such enormous magic power!

06:34.080 --> 06:36.290
He is even stronger than me...

06:37.310 --> 06:38.790
This is...

06:38.790 --> 06:41.210
...the power of Hunter Sung!

06:44.220 --> 06:45.590
Thank you.

06:45.590 --> 06:47.760
The re-evaluation process is complete.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.430
Here is your new Hunter license.

06:51.430 --> 06:54.890
Great, now it won't arouse any suspicion
to sell the Sphere of Avarice.

06:55.570 --> 06:57.770
I'll use that money to gear up.

06:57.770 --> 07:00.190
This time I'll conquer the Demon's Castle.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.860
With this,

07:01.860 --> 07:05.070
you are a real S-Rank Hunter.

07:05.530 --> 07:10.640
I look forward to seeing
what great feats you'll achieve.

07:15.210 --> 07:18.040
Congratulations on becoming
an S-Rank Hunter.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.250
May I express my gratitude
for what you did before?

07:22.250 --> 07:24.880
I also have something to discuss with you.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.340
May I take a moment of your time?

07:27.340 --> 07:29.760
Sorry, I have other matters to attend to.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.100
Ah, there...

07:31.570 --> 07:32.910
Huh? What?

07:37.400 --> 07:39.400
H-Hey...

07:39.400 --> 07:40.770
Hmm?

07:41.290 --> 07:42.270
Hey...

07:42.270 --> 07:44.110
Hey!

07:44.110 --> 07:45.400
What?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.720
Jinwoo...

07:46.720 --> 07:48.780
Jinah, your brother is on TV.

07:48.780 --> 07:49.970
What?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.450
THE 10TH S-RANK HUNTER
IN HISTORY HAS APPEARED!

07:53.450 --> 07:55.720
No way! How?!

07:57.210 --> 07:59.290
- He's on the news.
- We just received the latest information.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.210
- Didn't I tell you?
- About an hour ago,

08:01.210 --> 08:04.300
- That kid must have killed someone.
- under the guidance of Chairman Go,

08:04.300 --> 08:06.630
- Let me see what he's done.
- Hunter Sung received a re-evaluation

08:06.630 --> 08:09.340
and was officially assessed as S-Rank.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.050
What?!

08:11.050 --> 08:12.970
The association's database
has been updated.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.770
Although not officially announced,

08:14.770 --> 08:17.250
it is confirmed that he received
the S-Rank evaluation.

08:17.250 --> 08:20.840
He became the nation's
10th S-Rank Hunter.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.820
It is a major event two years
after Hunter Cha appeared.

08:27.780 --> 08:30.240
- S-Rank! He is the 10th S-Rank!
- Ah, wait...

08:30.240 --> 08:32.580
- Quick, over there!
- My press conference...

08:32.580 --> 08:33.700
Don't let him get away!

08:35.350 --> 08:38.280
I couldn't persuade Mr. Sung
to change his mind.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.750
Is that so?

08:41.960 --> 08:42.960
I'm sorry.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.850
I have something I must complete alone.

08:47.820 --> 08:52.290
For this, I must keep fighting
and become stronger.

08:52.890 --> 08:56.440
Joining any organization now
will only hinder my progress.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.060
Jinho.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.610
So, I...

09:05.480 --> 09:06.460
And then...

09:07.050 --> 09:09.500
Mr. Sung asked me to follow him.

09:10.910 --> 09:14.990
Do you know how selfish
your decision is?

09:16.740 --> 09:20.460
I originally entrusted
this project to Jinsung.

09:20.910 --> 09:25.840
Then you came to me
and made a grand speech.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.590
Not only do you accomplish nothing,

09:27.950 --> 09:30.590
but now you want to abandon
everything and leave.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.340
Do you think that's fair?

09:41.100 --> 09:42.480
I'm really sorry, Father.

09:42.980 --> 09:43.810
Even so,

09:44.320 --> 09:46.230
I still have to go to Mr. Sung.

09:52.570 --> 09:53.490
Then,

09:53.990 --> 09:56.570
you have to make
a corresponding conclusion.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.010
Please step back.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.880
Please don't forcefully take photos.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.170
- Don't push, it's dangerous
- Dealing with them will only wear you out.

10:07.530 --> 10:10.020
We will take you back to your home.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.130
Don't bother.

10:17.890 --> 10:22.840
So strong physically,
yet he's also a Mage...

10:23.400 --> 10:24.600
President Baek?

10:25.600 --> 10:26.690
So fast!

10:26.690 --> 10:28.200
My eyes can't keep up!

10:29.240 --> 10:31.530
He's become even stronger
than back then.

10:32.110 --> 10:33.710
Why is that?

10:35.610 --> 10:37.490
Next is the equipment.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.470
We've been expecting you, Hunter Sung.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.630
You want to purchase an artifact that can
defend against fire-based attacks, right?

10:46.630 --> 10:49.380
May I ask what it's for?

10:49.380 --> 10:52.510
To resist the heat in the dungeon.

10:52.510 --> 10:53.720
I see.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.350
In that case,

10:55.350 --> 10:57.770
how about these?

10:57.770 --> 11:00.010
It's a cloak that you wear
over your clothes.

11:00.010 --> 11:02.570
And a ring that is easy to wear.

11:02.570 --> 11:03.850
Not bad.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.020
It is also quite affordable.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.140
Ugh...

11:08.650 --> 11:10.980
Can you lower the price?

11:12.780 --> 11:18.280
I'm really sorry,
but the price in our store is fixed.

11:18.280 --> 11:23.000
However, if you can break the glass here,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.830
we can give you the product for free.

11:24.830 --> 11:25.960
Huh?

11:26.330 --> 11:31.090
The glass in our store is specially
reinforced with magic.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.550
- This one?
- Even an A-Rank Hunter

11:32.550 --> 11:34.180
- It does have magic power,
- can't cause any damage to it.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.740
- but is it really that sturdy?
- can't cause any damage to it.

11:35.740 --> 11:40.430
This is the only store
equipped with such devices.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.850
Wait...! Please stop!

11:42.850 --> 11:44.980
I was just joking.

11:44.980 --> 11:49.480
Even if it doesn't break,
a slight vibration will trigger the alarm.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.020
Ah, I see...

11:51.020 --> 11:52.110
I'm sorry.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.740
No, I took the joke too far.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.700
Ah, um...

11:57.700 --> 11:59.660
I'd like to see other things.

11:59.660 --> 12:00.890
Short swords, for example.

12:00.890 --> 12:04.370
Then let me assist you,
as I'm in charge of weapons.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.620
This way, please.

12:07.580 --> 12:08.500
Hmm?

12:10.170 --> 12:13.020
He didn't even touch it,
could it be...

12:14.120 --> 12:15.670
How much does this cost?

12:15.670 --> 12:17.630
That one...

12:17.630 --> 12:19.340
About this price.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.430
So much money for this?

12:21.430 --> 12:23.710
Its strength matches
Kasaka's Venom Fang at most.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.310
Ah...

12:25.930 --> 12:27.000
In that case...

12:27.690 --> 12:28.940
Mister?

12:28.940 --> 12:30.850
Uh...

12:31.290 --> 12:33.440
How much is this worth?

12:33.440 --> 12:35.360
This is...

12:35.790 --> 12:38.820
You can tell it was made
by a master craftsman.

12:38.820 --> 12:42.030
No, it's just a short sword
sold in the shop.

12:42.030 --> 12:44.990
I think it can be worth
at least a hundred million.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.370
A hundred million...?!

12:46.870 --> 12:49.690
For this short sword that I bought
with 2.8 million gold coins?

12:50.960 --> 12:53.920
Items bought in the shop
are worth so much money...

12:54.300 --> 12:57.210
Then I might not need
to sell the Sphere of Avarice.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.470
Can I use the restroom?

13:00.470 --> 13:02.390
S-Sure.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.810
I know he's very strong.

13:07.810 --> 13:10.770
But that is no longer a matter of levels.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.060
The unusual magic power
that pervades the appraisal hall,

13:14.060 --> 13:16.480
as well as his astonishing
physical abilities.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.360
His second awakening
should have ended long ago,

13:19.360 --> 13:21.660
but he has become even stronger.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.020
Is that really possible?

13:25.690 --> 13:28.540
Perhaps he's not undergoing
a second awakening...

13:28.540 --> 13:32.700
Could it be he's a Hunter who can
continuously grow stronger?

13:39.430 --> 13:42.380
Finally, no one is here.

13:42.380 --> 13:45.300
Now I can go to school.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.310
You mean the media?

13:46.850 --> 13:48.560
The association must have helped.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.960
Hey, be on TV if you like,
but don't get me involved!

13:52.960 --> 13:55.000
It's no use telling me...

13:55.610 --> 13:56.980
Ah, right.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.820
I'll be away for a week from tomorrow.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.240
What? Again?

14:01.240 --> 14:02.360
Why?

14:04.320 --> 14:05.870
Haven't you had enough...

14:06.830 --> 14:10.620
Your confidant Yoo Jinho is reporting in.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.920
Huh, is this your friend?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.130
Ah, you must be Jinwoo's sister.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.750
I am his right-hand man,

14:16.750 --> 14:18.130
Yoo Jinho.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.250
Well...

14:20.890 --> 14:23.880
I'll be working with him
for a week from tomorrow.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.510
Huh, tomorrow?

14:25.510 --> 14:27.510
- What are you...
- We're going to work.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.010
Right?

14:29.560 --> 14:30.640
Y-Yeah...

14:30.640 --> 14:33.440
We have an important job
that we have to do.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.780
It's come to a halt for now,
but the media has already reported it.

14:46.350 --> 14:47.290
Come out.

14:49.490 --> 14:50.540
Huh?

14:50.540 --> 14:53.080
Fang had four guards, didn't he?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.250
Where's the other one?

14:55.040 --> 14:56.460
Ah...

14:56.880 --> 15:00.800
I knocked it to the ceiling,
so Shadow Extraction didn't get it.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.590
Well, it doesn't matter.

15:02.590 --> 15:05.010
You're so strong,
so three of you should be enough.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.890
I'll bring you two soldiers.

15:07.890 --> 15:09.480
Protect Jinah.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.510
I'm leaving her to you.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.030
Let's use this opportunity
to strengthen security.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.000
Start patrolling.

15:25.820 --> 15:29.610
Does this count as contributing to society?

15:36.580 --> 15:39.740
Thank you for letting me
stay over last night.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.000
It's okay.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.590
But what do we do now?

15:43.590 --> 15:45.610
You didn't have to run away from home.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.640
This is the way I chose
to conclude things.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.100
By the way, what kind of work
are you doing at Daesung Tower?

15:52.470 --> 15:55.560
You said yesterday
you'd be away for a week.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.560
Well.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.190
It's kind of like training.

15:58.570 --> 16:00.150
You want to become even stronger?!

16:00.490 --> 16:02.370
You're already S-Rank.

16:02.910 --> 16:03.940
Yeah.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.280
Thank you.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.570
I'll be off.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.660
Okay, take care.

16:13.130 --> 16:16.580
A water-based ring and a robe of wind.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.790
Heat protection is done.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.850
The operation to conquer
Demon's Castle begins again.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.760
Quest info?

16:26.550 --> 16:29.760
"Collect Demon Souls 2."

16:29.760 --> 16:33.350
Collect the soul of the Demon Monarch Baran.

16:33.350 --> 16:36.180
The reward is the Shadow Exchange Rune Stone.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.230
Is this a job-specific skill?

16:38.230 --> 16:40.230
There are more rewards than last time.

16:40.230 --> 16:42.060
I can't wait.

16:42.770 --> 16:46.780
Move to the highest floor
from last time, the 76th floor.

16:50.780 --> 16:53.950
I didn't think Jinho would leave home.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.640
Do you feel lonely?

16:56.130 --> 16:59.540
Just a kid we raised
left our home, that's all.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.520
Rather, he's too old...

17:02.790 --> 17:03.850
To still stay...

17:04.500 --> 17:05.510
Dear?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.130
At home...

17:07.680 --> 17:08.670
Dear!

17:09.590 --> 17:10.960
Dear!

17:28.240 --> 17:29.940
Let's test it out.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.030
Come out, Fang.

18:22.410 --> 18:24.030
It turned to ashes...

18:24.030 --> 18:26.040
Even after it was weakened?

18:26.460 --> 18:29.530
I must consider
the situations for such skills.

18:30.050 --> 18:33.340
For now, I'll let Fang hold
the Sphere of Avarice.

18:34.630 --> 18:37.260
I see. So Jinho came here.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.680
Yes.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.100
I told Jinho you collapsed
due to overwork.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.060
I'm sorry.

18:44.850 --> 18:47.020
Eternal Slumber?

18:47.480 --> 18:48.480
Yes.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.930
It's a condition where one
is occasionally overwhelmed

18:50.930 --> 18:53.950
by sleepiness and will eventually
fall into an eternal sleep.

18:53.950 --> 18:56.740
Why did I get this disease?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.910
It is said that people
with low magic power resistance

18:59.910 --> 19:04.160
are prone to illness if exposed
to magic power for long periods.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.290
Is there a Hunter among
your relatives or friends?

19:09.960 --> 19:11.210
Dear...

19:13.510 --> 19:15.430
My son is a Hunter.

19:16.180 --> 19:19.910
But this has yet to be
confirmed as the cause.

19:21.350 --> 19:27.650
In this world of magic power,
I have no magic power resistance.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.690
Does it mean I've been eliminated...

19:33.370 --> 19:34.630
...by this world?

19:35.770 --> 19:38.530
It really is peaceful here.

19:38.530 --> 19:40.030
Yeah.

19:40.030 --> 19:41.910
How about going fishing later?

19:41.910 --> 19:43.250
Here you go again.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.000
We are on patrol.

19:45.660 --> 19:46.870
Huh?

19:47.670 --> 19:48.880
That is...

19:53.380 --> 19:58.680
It was correct to divide the soldiers into
six teams and have them act separately.

19:59.510 --> 20:03.220
When sending them out,
I gave the soldiers two orders.

20:03.930 --> 20:07.190
First, each team is to act separately
and kill all visible enemies.

20:07.810 --> 20:10.400
Second, notify me once
the entry permit is found.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.740
I won't be able to obtain items
other than the permit,

20:13.740 --> 20:16.110
but the pace of my advance
has significantly quickened.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.840
It should have been like this.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.300
It has been two days since
I reached the 80th floor,

20:21.300 --> 20:23.080
and the progress has slowed down.

20:23.910 --> 20:25.430
Is there some problem?

20:27.370 --> 20:29.830
Someone is continuously
destroying my soldiers.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.600
That's the High Orc Team A.

20:33.170 --> 20:36.500
I didn't expect there to be a high-level
demon that could defeat High Orcs.

20:37.590 --> 20:41.430
I'll call Team A back and investigate.

20:45.090 --> 20:47.940
After Team A was attacked,
Team B was also attacked.

20:48.350 --> 20:51.300
Whoever the enemy is,
it is formidable.

20:52.190 --> 20:53.550
But something is strange.

20:54.090 --> 20:57.200
The Fang team should be next to Team A.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.360
Why was the more distant
Team B attacked instead?

21:00.740 --> 21:02.910
Does this mean he is
not as strong as Fang?

21:03.950 --> 21:06.620
If he's targeting opponents
he thinks he can defeat,

21:06.620 --> 21:09.410
that means he has the intelligence
to assess strength.

21:09.410 --> 21:10.530
In this case,

21:11.580 --> 21:13.220
his next target is...

21:28.100 --> 21:29.060
I see.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.560
No wonder the magic beast soldiers
are no match for these guys.

21:51.580 --> 21:53.630
I have always been curious...

21:55.460 --> 21:58.300
Whether magic beasts can feel fear.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.430
Now...

22:02.430 --> 22:04.470
I finally found the answer.

22:41.050 --> 22:43.720
SOLO LEVELING

22:43.720 --> 22:47.220
EPISODE 19: THE 10TH S-RANK HUNTER

23:36.230 --> 23:39.980
EPISODE 20: LOOKING UP WAS TIRING ME OUT
