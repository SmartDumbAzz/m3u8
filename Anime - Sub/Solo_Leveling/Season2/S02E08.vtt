WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:11.210
I surrender!

00:12.170 --> 00:13.490
I surrender.

00:13.490 --> 00:14.740
Please spare my life.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.870
That voice...

00:17.870 --> 00:19.100
Are you...

00:27.510 --> 00:29.130
I-I'm sorry!

00:29.130 --> 00:30.800
We lost!

00:30.800 --> 00:33.030
Please spare me!

00:42.730 --> 00:46.480
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

02:05.230 --> 02:07.980
You attacked us, and now you
want me to spare your life?

02:08.480 --> 02:10.940
I killed all your companions.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.400
It is the duty of a knight
to protect the lord.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.660
As long as I am safe,

02:15.660 --> 02:17.680
I'm sure they will be happy.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.910
How could you say that...

02:21.500 --> 02:22.250
Never mind.

02:28.710 --> 02:29.960
This is my chance!

02:36.030 --> 02:37.390
What are you trying to pull?

02:37.740 --> 02:41.010
I will do anything
as long as you spare my life!

02:41.010 --> 02:42.600
So please show mercy!

02:42.600 --> 02:44.000
This one...

02:45.190 --> 02:48.520
Can you get the floor entry permit?

02:49.020 --> 02:50.790
The entry permit...

02:50.790 --> 02:53.150
My family is currently keeping it.

02:53.150 --> 02:55.740
If you spare my life,
I can give it to you.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.950
I know the locations
of all the upper-level permits.

02:59.950 --> 03:03.330
If you can ensure the safety
of me and my family,

03:03.330 --> 03:04.450
I can take you there.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.150
So you hid them, huh?

03:07.670 --> 03:10.670
No wonder I can't get them
by defeating opponents.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.170
But the question is...

03:14.550 --> 03:18.260
Can I trust you?

03:19.180 --> 03:20.970
O-Of course...

03:21.440 --> 03:25.180
I'm not lying to you...

03:27.690 --> 03:29.020
Alright.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.900
As long as I get the permit,
I will spare you.

03:32.570 --> 03:35.070
T-Thank you very much...

03:36.740 --> 03:37.820
By the way...

03:38.490 --> 03:40.090
Who are you people?

03:57.380 --> 04:00.430
I am Esil, the eldest daughter
of the Radiru family.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.630
No, that's not what I wanted to ask.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.020
I thought I could get information

04:07.020 --> 04:10.230
about the system from magic beasts
other than Baruka...

04:11.980 --> 04:16.530
In your minds, do you constantly
hear voices telling you to kill humans?

04:16.530 --> 04:17.620
Huh?

04:17.620 --> 04:19.410
Hmm...

04:19.410 --> 04:20.280
No.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.870
But we do hear another command.

04:22.870 --> 04:23.700
What command?

04:24.660 --> 04:26.660
\"Protect our space.\"

04:27.660 --> 04:28.620
Since when?

04:28.620 --> 04:30.830
Since we came here.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.790
Since you came here?

04:33.210 --> 04:34.710
Where were you before?

04:34.710 --> 04:35.950
The Demon Realm.

04:35.950 --> 04:39.370
We found ourselves in this place
when we came to our senses one day.

04:40.010 --> 04:43.010
What were you doing
in the Demon Realm?

04:45.810 --> 04:46.930
A war...

04:48.020 --> 04:50.390
We were preparing for a war.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.100
A war?

04:52.100 --> 04:53.470
Who were you going to fight?

04:54.360 --> 04:58.650
A formidable enemy who is so strong that
all the demons had to unite to fight.

04:59.110 --> 05:02.590
At that time, we were on the eve
of fighting that powerful enemy.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.830
This is not disclosable information.

05:06.830 --> 05:08.410
The conversation has been blocked.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.830
This is not disclosable information.

05:10.830 --> 05:12.460
The conversation has been blocked.

05:12.460 --> 05:13.170
This is not...

05:18.380 --> 05:20.430
It seems I can't ask further questions.

05:23.130 --> 05:26.510
Here is the disaster caused

05:26.510 --> 05:29.390
by a winged ant magic beast landing
on the Japanese outlying islands

05:29.390 --> 05:30.930
and its subjugation record.

05:31.690 --> 05:34.510
A total of 294 civilian casualties.

05:34.510 --> 05:37.710
108 Hunters engaged in the battle.

05:37.710 --> 05:39.230
Among them,

05:39.230 --> 05:42.650
4 E-Rank Hunters, 1 C-Rank Hunter,
and 1 B-Rank Hunter died.

05:43.950 --> 05:46.620
Just one magic beast
caused such casualties...

05:47.080 --> 05:50.910
The A-Rank Hunter
who arrived later killed it.

05:50.910 --> 05:52.620
Only then was it subjugated.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.830
So, the strength
of the winged ant is A-Rank.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.770
It's consistent with the conclusion

05:58.770 --> 06:01.550
of the investigation department
after dissecting the body.

06:04.510 --> 06:08.560
That island is 120 kilometers
from Jeju Island.

06:09.350 --> 06:12.680
If those ants gain
stronger flying ability,

06:12.680 --> 06:15.060
they can land
on the southern tip of our nation.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.570
Immediately request support from Japan.

06:19.190 --> 06:23.030
Warn neighboring countries to be vigilant.

06:23.030 --> 06:23.570
Yes.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.700
What was bound to come is coming.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.530
Now every second counts.

06:27.530 --> 06:32.010
I wanted to strike first
before there were casualties.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Now, as the president
of the Hunter's Association,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.450
I order to commence
the fourth Jeju Island raid mission.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.050
I'm sorry...

06:44.050 --> 06:47.430
I don't know why I fainted.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.570
No, it's okay.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.890
Do you feel unwell?

06:51.890 --> 06:54.060
No, I'm fine.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.690
So you are worried about me.

06:56.690 --> 06:58.310
Well, sort of.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.440
By the way, are we almost there?

07:02.440 --> 07:04.150
Ah, yes.

07:04.150 --> 07:06.400
That is the castle
where the Radiru family resides.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.390
The permit is inside.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.290
What on earth that man
did you bring here?!

07:12.290 --> 07:13.470
Esil!

07:13.470 --> 07:14.250
Eh?

07:14.250 --> 07:16.410
D-Didn't you see it?!

07:16.410 --> 07:19.920
Those countless troops
lurking in that man's shadow!

07:20.320 --> 07:21.380
Oh?

07:21.380 --> 07:22.880
He is very perceptive.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.550
If you want to deceive my daughter
and then take over the castle,

07:26.550 --> 07:28.180
don't expect to get out alive!

07:28.180 --> 07:30.800
Father, wait!

07:30.800 --> 07:33.220
I have promised her.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.520
As long as you give me the permit,
I won't harm her.

07:38.890 --> 07:42.190
I heard that he had defeated
Vulcan and Metus.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.600
That means he isn't an opponent
we can defeat.

07:47.950 --> 07:49.280
Heck...

07:54.330 --> 07:56.290
ITEM: ENTRY PERMIT

07:57.290 --> 07:58.990
I'll take it.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.790
So you're done, aren't you?

08:02.790 --> 08:04.500
Then leave quickly!

08:04.880 --> 08:05.960
There's one more thing.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.430
I need to borrow her.

08:08.430 --> 08:09.430
Eh?

08:09.430 --> 08:10.430
What...?

08:12.550 --> 08:13.680
Ah, no.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.430
I need her as a guide.

08:15.430 --> 08:18.730
She said she knows the locations
of the permits on each floor.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.770
Can you guarantee my daughter's safety?

08:22.180 --> 08:23.480
Yes.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.360
Alright, then.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.700
I understand.

08:29.070 --> 08:30.280
That's it.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.820
Please show me the way, Esil.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.020
Okay.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.500
Guild master.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.180
YOU HAVE DEFEATED A DEMON KNIGHT

08:53.180 --> 08:54.390
YOU HAVE DEFEATED A DEMON NOBLE

08:54.890 --> 08:56.770
ITEM: ENTRY PERMIT 90TH FLOOR

08:57.140 --> 08:58.140
Good.

08:58.140 --> 09:00.260
Now the 89th floor is completed.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.010
Igris and Tank have both leveled up.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.570
Their strength is about
S-Rank and A-Rank.

09:09.570 --> 09:11.640
I'm also gaining combat power.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.950
Good grief...

09:14.950 --> 09:20.160
Now the gifts prepared
for negotiations are wasted.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.170
You can take them back.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.830
I can't do that.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.090
The floors above the 90th floor are
managed by high-ranking nobles.

09:27.710 --> 09:30.550
They are on a different level
than the lower ones.

09:31.010 --> 09:34.340
So, getting permits through
conversation might be more...

09:34.340 --> 09:38.770
If I were weaker than you,
would you have a conversation with me?

09:40.140 --> 09:41.730
That's how things are.

09:42.190 --> 09:45.190
Aren't you competing in rankings
with other Demon Nobles?

09:45.860 --> 09:49.570
I will make the Radis family number one.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.970
It's Radiru...

09:51.970 --> 09:53.070
Wait.

09:53.070 --> 09:57.530
Jinwoo, why did you spare my family?

09:58.120 --> 09:59.740
Because I like you.

09:59.740 --> 10:00.660
Huh...?

10:00.660 --> 10:01.960
What?!

10:02.380 --> 10:04.350
First, it was Jinho,
now it's Esil.

10:04.350 --> 10:08.670
I do get along well
with simple-minded people.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.840
Esil, you can go back.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.180
Eh? What?!

10:13.680 --> 10:16.340
You said the next enemies
would be stronger.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.600
I also promised your father.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.100
Just tell me the location of the permits.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.640
I can handle the rest myself.

10:23.180 --> 10:26.480
Am I so useless to you?

10:26.480 --> 10:29.310
It's not like that.
You've done a good job.

10:29.900 --> 10:30.860
Good work.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.150
Thank you.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.610
I will follow you till the end!

10:35.610 --> 10:36.820
I want to see...

10:37.230 --> 10:39.470
...what kind of achievements
you can achieve!

10:41.040 --> 10:42.540
I understand.

10:42.540 --> 10:43.580
Then, let's go.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.290
Yes.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.630
As Esil said,

10:51.630 --> 10:54.050
the difficulty increased drastically
from the 90th floor.

10:54.690 --> 10:57.260
The strength and quantity
of the guardian magic beasts

10:57.700 --> 10:59.930
are completely different from before.

11:00.510 --> 11:04.560
But I'm still climbing
to the top step by step.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.690
I must get the materials
for the Elixir of Life.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.360
For that...

11:15.390 --> 11:20.200
Both you and I received a call
for the fourth Jeju Island raid mission.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.160
Yes.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.950
Besides us, it seems President Baek
from the White Tiger Guild

11:24.950 --> 11:29.000
and all S-Rank Hunters in the country
have also been called.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.670
Then Hunter Sung too...

11:31.670 --> 11:37.630
It has been officially decided to cooperate
with the neighboring country this time.

11:38.180 --> 11:39.640
Do you mean Japan?

11:39.640 --> 11:40.550
Yes.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.470
Considering the flying ability
of the winged ants,

11:43.470 --> 11:45.980
they are also within
the attack range.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.560
This is a natural decision.

11:49.060 --> 11:53.100
As long as they can be eliminated,
it doesn't matter who does it.

11:54.530 --> 11:56.030
When do we take action?

11:56.380 --> 11:57.780
It has not been decided yet.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.350
But I think it will start soon.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.370
Also...

12:01.990 --> 12:04.430
To discuss the battle plan,

12:04.430 --> 12:08.810
the Hunters from ultra-large guilds
will come to our nation today.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.710
I finally reached the top floor.

12:15.170 --> 12:17.300
But there's no one here...

12:32.400 --> 12:33.610
That is...

12:33.610 --> 12:35.070
The Lord of the Demons,

12:36.230 --> 12:37.150
Baran.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.620
THE DEMON MONARCH BARAN

12:45.200 --> 12:47.040
His aura is overwhelming.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.080
Can I defeat him?

12:49.620 --> 12:52.160
I feel like I'm being cut down
by his bloodlust!

12:53.160 --> 12:55.200
He's so strong that even Esil can feel it.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.500
And now,

12:57.340 --> 12:58.670
this is going to be annoying.

12:58.670 --> 12:59.470
KAISELLIN THE WYVERN

12:59.920 --> 13:00.970
A wyvern?

13:00.970 --> 13:02.800
Are there non-demon
creatures as well?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.470
There are quite a lot of them.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.170
W-What should we do?

13:34.380 --> 13:35.330
Jinwoo!

13:35.880 --> 13:36.590
I know.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.420
Come out.

14:01.190 --> 14:02.650
That's amazing...

14:02.650 --> 14:05.450
Jinwoo can use this kind
of combat technique.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.170
But we're against
the Demon Monarch Baran,

14:09.170 --> 14:10.450
the ruler of this place.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.920
And Jinwoo is just an invader
that just needs to be eliminated.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.420
Which side should I choose?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.080
This is not ordinary lightning.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.330
It's a wide-range attack
with a stun effect.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.420
Although my soldiers can be revived,

14:56.420 --> 14:59.470
if they keep getting hit by it,
my MP will soon run out.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.550
I must act before that.

15:03.510 --> 15:05.300
ACTIVE SKILL: STEALTH

15:05.300 --> 15:06.720
ACTIVE SKILL: DASH

15:11.010 --> 15:12.970
I'll go for the wings first!

15:14.430 --> 15:16.480
Did he detect my stealth?

15:25.530 --> 15:27.240
It can track me!

15:27.240 --> 15:29.070
Darn it, I will be caught up!

15:29.070 --> 15:30.910
Fang, Igris!

15:57.600 --> 15:59.190
I finally got you down here.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.940
Looking up all this time
made my neck sore.

16:02.940 --> 16:04.070
This is much better.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.580
Nice to meet you all.

16:13.580 --> 16:17.000
I am Hanekawa from
the Draw Sword Guild.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.400
This is the guild master,
Goto Ryuji.

16:20.330 --> 16:23.500
He will communicate with you
through my translation.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.390
Draw Sword Guild.

16:25.920 --> 16:30.130
A super large guild in Japan
with eleven S-Rank Hunters.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.160
It's reputed to be
the second largest in Asia.

16:34.160 --> 16:34.970
And...

16:35.560 --> 16:38.510
Goto Ryuji, who manages the entire guild,

16:38.510 --> 16:41.440
does live up to the reputation
with his awe-inspiring aura.

16:42.270 --> 16:43.190
First of all,

16:43.190 --> 16:47.900
thank you for accepting the proposal to form
a joint assault team and work together.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.200
Please don't say so.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.450
We were the ones
who first requested support.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.490
We should thank you for your consent.

16:54.870 --> 16:56.870
As shown in the files,

16:56.870 --> 17:02.610
we have come to many conclusions
from the information you provided

17:02.610 --> 17:04.690
and the dissection results
of the winged ants.

17:05.660 --> 17:06.750
Among them,

17:06.750 --> 17:09.720
there are two key points
related to this operation.

17:10.590 --> 17:11.720
One is its lifespan.

17:12.300 --> 17:17.180
Ants grow rapidly after hatching,
but they only live for about a year.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.020
That means, that as long as
the queen ant is killed,

17:20.020 --> 17:23.400
the remaining ants
will die after a year.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.900
The other is the ants' behavior patterns.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.490
From the records
of the past three raid missions,

17:29.490 --> 17:35.370
we found that ants are attracted by powerful
enemies, that is, strong magic power.

17:35.370 --> 17:39.580
This time, we will use this habit
to devise a combat plan.

17:40.750 --> 17:44.210
We also noticed the ants' actions.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.020
But I didn't know they analyzed it
so thoroughly...

17:49.050 --> 17:50.420
As for this operation,

17:50.940 --> 17:55.050
among the eleven S-Rank Hunters
of Draw Sword Guild,

17:55.050 --> 17:57.890
ten will be dispatched,
including me.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.770
Ten out of eleven...

18:01.150 --> 18:03.640
We will lure out all the ants.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.570
Your responsibility is
to kill the queen ant.

18:07.570 --> 18:10.700
But this way, you will have to
face thousands of ants...

18:11.240 --> 18:14.530
If we're only acting as bait,
this is not a problem.

18:14.530 --> 18:19.180
The AI simulation also indicates
that this is the best tactic.

18:19.830 --> 18:24.540
Indeed, we can't mobilize
ten S-Rank Hunters...

18:24.540 --> 18:25.500
Well...

18:26.040 --> 18:27.540
I understand.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.340
Then we will plan
the operation details based on that.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.600
I have no chance
to restore MP with a potion.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.790
He was able to block my critical attack?!

19:33.400 --> 19:35.190
Is my MP depleted?

20:18.900 --> 20:20.410
Darn it, my daggers...!

20:31.130 --> 20:32.930
His strength is unbelievable!

20:34.800 --> 20:35.590
No way!

20:37.340 --> 20:38.260
I can't dodge it!

20:44.810 --> 20:45.890
Now's my chance!

20:45.890 --> 20:50.310
With my strength stat that I've boosted
and the 'Ruler's Hand'...

21:06.830 --> 21:10.750
This is the end!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.200
Jinwoo...

21:31.020 --> 21:32.230
YOU HAVE DEFEATED
THE DEMON MONARCH BARAN

21:32.230 --> 21:33.600
YOU HAVE ACQUIRED BARAN'S SOUL

21:33.600 --> 21:35.650
QUEST: COLLECT DEMON SOULS 2

21:46.700 --> 21:47.910
Jinwoo!

21:48.330 --> 21:51.410
Esil, go back and report to your father.

21:52.330 --> 21:55.920
From now on, the Radis family
will be at the top of the rank.

21:56.710 --> 21:58.000
Jinwoo...

22:01.800 --> 22:03.300
It's not Radis.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.990
It's Radiru.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.760
SOLO LEVELING

22:44.760 --> 22:48.260
EPISODE 20: LOOKING UP WAS TIRING ME OUT

23:37.480 --> 23:41.020
EPISODE 21: IT WAS ALL WORTH IT
