00:09.600 --> 00:13.350
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

01:36.910 --> 01:39.050
Purified Blood of the Demon Monarch.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.210
Now I have everything I need.

01:44.940 --> 01:48.990
The rate of success and quantity
depend on intelligence level?

01:49.950 --> 01:52.170
Jinwoo, are you alright?

01:55.820 --> 01:56.660
Craft.

02:16.890 --> 02:18.890
The Elixir of Life is complete.

02:19.390 --> 02:24.180
But, will this cure
my mother's Eternal Slumber?

02:29.110 --> 02:31.770
Iron, you're unusually
quick-witted today.

02:34.620 --> 02:35.750
Arise.

02:47.550 --> 02:48.910
The name...

02:49.460 --> 02:52.420
Kesslin... Kekalin...

02:52.420 --> 02:53.720
What was its name again?

02:53.720 --> 02:57.590
Jinwoo, you're terrible
at remembering names.

02:57.590 --> 02:58.680
Well, whatever.

02:59.140 --> 03:00.180
Your name...

03:00.810 --> 03:01.810
...shall be 'Kaisel.'

03:07.360 --> 03:09.900
With this dragon,
we'll return home in no time.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.070
Let's hold a party when we return!

03:12.070 --> 03:14.050
My father will be delighted!

03:15.780 --> 03:17.450
- Umm...
- I want to test

03:17.450 --> 03:19.200
- Hey!
- the elixir's effects immediately.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.750
Are you listening?

03:20.750 --> 03:23.420
- We're having a party!
- Right, there's a rune stone in the reward.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.620
A joyous party!

03:24.620 --> 03:25.330
No...

03:26.630 --> 03:28.130
Not this either.

03:28.130 --> 03:29.420
Ermm...

03:30.170 --> 03:31.630
Ah, here it is.

03:37.970 --> 03:39.640
Shadow Exchange...

03:40.100 --> 03:44.730
Does this mean I can switch places with
my Shadow Soldiers wherever they are?

03:45.150 --> 03:46.020
In that case...

03:47.980 --> 03:50.690
Sorry, Esil, you go back alone.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.320
Huh? What about the party?

03:52.320 --> 03:55.070
The Radis family lives on the 80th floor.

03:55.070 --> 03:56.950
It's too far for a detour.

03:56.950 --> 03:58.540
No way...

03:59.490 --> 04:01.290
Let's meet again if fate allows.

04:01.830 --> 04:02.880
Take care.

04:03.370 --> 04:05.500
Jinwoo, I...

04:06.470 --> 04:07.080
Hmm?

04:08.660 --> 04:09.710
Huh?

04:21.220 --> 04:24.120
I really switched places
with the patrol soldiers.

04:25.270 --> 04:27.850
It takes three hours
before I can reuse it.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.650
Then the remaining journey...

04:31.230 --> 04:32.150
Kaisel.

04:38.530 --> 04:42.240
We'll use Hunters' magical power as bait
to lure out the ants.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.000
Then use special interference waves
to disrupt their sensory communication.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.590
The special forces will seize
this chance to infiltrate the nest

04:50.590 --> 04:53.210
and eliminate the queen ant, huh?

04:53.840 --> 04:57.300
The issue is whether the interference
waves will work properly.

04:59.470 --> 05:03.100
It'd be a lie to say I don't feel uneasy.

05:03.100 --> 05:07.020
However the investigation results are accurate,
and the conclusions align with ours.

05:07.520 --> 05:12.650
We've also established a retreat plan
if the interference wave fails.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.490
What we should do...

05:16.490 --> 05:20.780
...is to make thorough preparations
to send Hunters to that island.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.190
Yes.

05:22.780 --> 05:23.910
Additionally...

05:24.580 --> 05:26.870
Have you been able
to contact Hunter Sung?

05:26.870 --> 05:28.420
Not yet.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.670
Yoonho.

05:32.670 --> 05:36.340
We rarely go drinking, so cheer up.

05:36.340 --> 05:39.010
That was funny, wasn't it?

05:39.930 --> 05:42.760
Byung-Gu, I don't understand at all.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.350
Frowning will make you age faster.

05:45.350 --> 05:46.640
Mind your own business!

05:49.640 --> 05:52.160
S-Rank healer, Min Byung-Gu.

05:52.160 --> 05:56.900
He is one of the few Hunters in the world
who retired young with all limbs intact.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.450
He's also my life-and-death companion.

06:01.910 --> 06:06.780
Just like his weird sense of humor,
he remains an eccentric.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.660
Since when are you so tactful?

06:09.660 --> 06:10.620
Yoonho.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.040
Are you really going?

06:15.170 --> 06:15.920
Yeah.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.010
You saw how Eunseok died.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.120
That's exactly why I must go.

06:27.930 --> 06:32.480
If we let those ants run wild,
the whole country will soon become like that.

06:33.030 --> 06:35.770
Since when were you so patriotic?

06:35.770 --> 06:40.570
I have to go either way,
so I might as well do it for a good reason.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.950
He said the same thing just like you.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.920
I'm not going. Never.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.710
If you came to invite me, thenâ€”

06:53.710 --> 06:55.580
I came to say goodbye.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.840
I might not be able to see you again.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.800
I plan to take the civil service exam.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.470
The civil service exam?

07:06.140 --> 07:09.930
I don't want to see any more blood.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.370
That's why I want to be a civil servant.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.130
But I'm only good at history.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.360
So the exam might be tough.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.860
Are you good at history?

07:19.860 --> 07:22.860
You know how much
I love historical dramas, right?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.070
Do you?

07:24.660 --> 07:27.050
But that's how normal life should be.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.620
Battles should remain confined to history.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.620
Yes, you are right.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.710
It's Hunters who are not normal.

07:37.420 --> 07:38.750
Come to think of it,

07:38.750 --> 07:43.220
I haven't met many Hunters
who hate fighting magic beasts.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.180
Fighting has become routine now.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.930
Some even enjoy it...

07:48.970 --> 07:51.850
Could it be, that's the condition
for awakening...

07:51.850 --> 07:52.930
Yoonho.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.900
You're frowning again.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.360
Shut up and drink!

07:58.520 --> 08:00.690
Very sly, Your Excellency.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.280
Why are you speaking like that?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.680
That burn mark was my fault.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.990
She might not be able to drink it.

08:46.780 --> 08:50.200
Even if she does,
no one knows what will happen.

08:51.200 --> 08:51.910
But...

08:53.330 --> 08:56.670
I've witnessed countless miracles
from the system.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.900
Including that I grew so much
from E-Rank.

09:04.050 --> 09:05.590
I'll trust it.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.190
Mom.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.240
Please open your eyes.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.330
I keep fighting and growing for you.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.420
Please wake up...

10:23.210 --> 10:24.210
Mom...

10:28.970 --> 10:32.360
I couldn't focus all day...
Why is that?

10:42.850 --> 10:44.550
The wind feels warm.

11:16.930 --> 11:18.010
You're Jinwoo...

11:18.010 --> 11:19.290
Right?

11:22.020 --> 11:24.700
How long was I asleep?

11:27.150 --> 11:28.190
Four years.

11:28.650 --> 11:29.770
You slept for four years.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.400
How is Jinah?

11:33.400 --> 11:34.540
She's good.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.290
Thank you, Jinwoo.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.000
You kept your promise.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.920
You've become so mature.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.770
But you're covered in wounds.

11:52.340 --> 11:55.850
You must have pushed
yourself too hard, right?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.210
It must have been tough for you.

12:10.780 --> 12:11.860
It's nothing...

12:12.570 --> 12:13.780
I'm fine...

12:16.320 --> 12:17.560
I'm fine...

12:29.290 --> 12:30.460
Thank you.

12:31.630 --> 12:32.660
Jinwoo.

12:39.220 --> 12:39.900
Yes...

12:42.730 --> 12:44.890
The patient with Eternal Slumber
has awoken?!

12:44.890 --> 12:47.270
Yes, I know it's hard to believe.

12:47.730 --> 12:51.400
Moreover, the patient's body
shows no abnormalities.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.530
The patient and their family
want to be discharged immediately.

13:00.490 --> 13:02.950
Jinah, you've grown so much.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.560
Mom...

13:09.790 --> 13:12.570
I'm sorry for worrying you.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.070
All my efforts have been rewarded.

13:16.590 --> 13:20.330
I've finally received the real reward.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.030
Thank you all for gathering here today.

13:28.520 --> 13:33.570
As you all know,
disasters are now occurring nationwide

13:33.570 --> 13:37.910
due to winged ant magic beasts
from Jeju Island.

13:37.910 --> 13:41.200
In response to this situation,
the Hunter's Association...

13:41.200 --> 13:45.410
...has decided to initiate
the \"4th Jeju Island Raid Mission.\"

13:45.950 --> 13:50.120
This operation will involve
not only domestic S-Rank Hunters

13:50.510 --> 13:55.300
but also 10 S-Rank Hunters from Japan.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.880
Hunters of A-Rank and below

13:58.880 --> 14:01.840
will handle maritime surveillance
and homeland defense

14:01.840 --> 14:07.230
to jointly support this operation
and protect other members.

14:08.350 --> 14:12.150
This time, we are determined to succeed.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.950
Eunseok...

14:19.320 --> 14:21.610
To be honest, I'm scared.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.870
Me too.

14:25.330 --> 14:30.500
But those who can't fight
must be far more scared than us.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.920
We'll end this.

14:32.420 --> 14:35.000
This is something only
we can accomplish.

14:35.590 --> 14:38.760
We can't let this country
become an ant nest.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.220
Darn it!

14:41.590 --> 14:44.250
I'll crush those things
with my bare hands...

14:46.100 --> 14:48.470
Yoonho is someone to worry about.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.060
Both in personality and abilities.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.950
The only ones who can help him
at critical times...

14:54.730 --> 14:56.060
...are you and me.

15:07.870 --> 15:08.830
Hey...

15:09.310 --> 15:11.720
You do indulge yourself when I'm away.

15:11.720 --> 15:15.460
Alright, let's start
our first cleaning in four years.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.270
The three of us will do it together.

15:19.170 --> 15:21.880
This house has aged quite a bit.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.090
The grime won't come off easily.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.310
After all, we've lived here
since I was born.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.100
You're right.

15:30.140 --> 15:32.160
This is the scene I've longed for.

15:33.310 --> 15:33.980
But...

15:34.560 --> 15:36.080
My heart is filled with unease.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.570
While being a Hunter...

15:40.990 --> 15:44.530
...did I cross a line
that should never be crossed?

15:46.530 --> 15:47.340
Jinwoo.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.290
Huh? What is it?

15:51.620 --> 15:54.500
Has your father contacted you?

15:59.090 --> 16:01.380
By the way, I saw the news.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.430
That you became a Hunter.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.050
Mhm.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.410
Your father was a firefighter
before becoming a Hunter.

16:08.410 --> 16:12.640
I married him because I thought
he looked cool when saving lives.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.910
You've inherited his trait.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.190
I'm also trying to become a doctor
to heal people.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.570
Yes, that's right.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.280
Jinah, you've inherited it too.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.280
Right?

16:26.910 --> 16:27.820
Hello?

16:29.030 --> 16:29.910
Phew...

16:30.410 --> 16:32.290
You handled the press conference well.

16:32.870 --> 16:33.580
Yeah.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.040
Thank you for attending as well.

16:36.040 --> 16:36.900
It's nothing.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.050
I didn't expect him to visit
after the press conference.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.670
Thomas Andre.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.700
He's the America's S-Rank
national authority Hunter.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.430
I half-expected him to come help.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.640
Given the timing,
it was reasonable.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.980
But someone with power
tantamount to the national military

16:58.980 --> 17:02.150
usually wouldn't intervene
in a foreign country's operations.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.240
True.

17:04.150 --> 17:06.900
But then, why would he...

17:06.900 --> 17:11.830
Maybe as he claimed,
he was just passing through.

17:11.830 --> 17:15.500
He may have come to intimidate us
regarding Hunter Hwang

17:15.910 --> 17:19.620
or to verify something.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.670
Is Hunter Sung still unreachable?

17:23.670 --> 17:25.380
No, we just contacted him.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.260
He should arrive soon.

17:29.390 --> 17:31.470
We'll depart in four days.

17:31.930 --> 17:34.810
This raid mission has been
our long-cherished goal.

17:34.810 --> 17:37.020
Will you lend us your strength?

17:38.770 --> 17:41.310
It's a prime opportunity for leveling up.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.780
A pity to pass up.

17:43.650 --> 17:45.740
I would've thought so before.

17:50.780 --> 17:51.520
I...

17:53.700 --> 17:55.110
Magical power waves?!

17:56.660 --> 18:00.020
It's truly impressive that you can
sense it from this distance.

18:00.750 --> 18:05.290
The S-Rank Hunters are
warming up at the gymnasium.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.300
If you're interested,
you can go take a look.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.730
Instructor Baek!

18:24.730 --> 18:28.990
You're still young, so shouldn't you work on
strengthening your legs and back a bit more?

18:28.990 --> 18:32.740
I'm just an office worker now,
Instructor Ma!

18:34.250 --> 18:38.530
S-Rank Hunters rarely gather like this.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.790
The magical power wave earlier
must have been from them.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.670
Hunter Baek is being pushed back.

18:46.670 --> 18:51.380
If President Baek goes all out,
Hunter Ma probably couldn't withstand it.

18:52.010 --> 18:52.970
Hello.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.980
The person wearing the dobok
is Ma Dongwook from the Fame Guild.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.140
Why isn't he using full strength?

19:01.140 --> 19:04.520
The opponent doesn't seem like someone
he needs to hold back against.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.900
It's undesirable to show his true power
in front of so many people.

19:08.290 --> 19:12.610
When he fights at full power,
he becomes a real monster.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.740
So the rumors about
the transformation-type Hunter are true.

19:15.740 --> 19:20.120
Also, those people over there
are from the Knights Guild...

19:22.040 --> 19:23.120
Oh?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.000
They've come too.

19:26.460 --> 19:32.470
They're Japan's S-Rank Hunters
and Guild Master Goto Ryuji.

19:32.810 --> 19:35.180
Hmm? Who's that?

19:35.640 --> 19:36.600
Ah...

19:36.600 --> 19:40.470
That's Hunter Sung Jinwoo,
who recently became an S-Rank Hunter.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.390
Seems to be a highly capable Assassin.

19:42.860 --> 19:45.400
No. He's a Mage.

19:47.730 --> 19:48.730
A Mage?

19:50.610 --> 19:51.610
Oh?

19:51.610 --> 19:56.200
Isn't that Hunter Sung
who embarrassed our Minsung?

19:57.420 --> 19:59.690
No wonder the atmosphere here changed.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.630
So they are this country's top forces.

20:09.630 --> 20:10.800
Somewhat disappointing.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.510
Maybe because I'm always
watching Mr. Goto's battles,

20:14.510 --> 20:16.800
they don't look like
S-Rank to me at all.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.430
It's too early to judge.

20:18.430 --> 20:20.640
I can't let that comment slide.

20:21.050 --> 20:22.060
Miss Translator.

20:22.060 --> 20:24.350
You were mocking us just now, weren't you?

20:24.350 --> 20:26.400
I can tell even if it's in Japanese.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.980
Brilliant, Guild Master!

20:28.410 --> 20:29.360
You are...

20:29.360 --> 20:32.440
This is the Guild Master
of the Knights Guild,

20:32.440 --> 20:34.240
Mr. Park Jongsoo.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.530
Park Jongsoo?

20:35.530 --> 20:36.910
Never heard of him.

20:37.710 --> 20:40.910
The Master is an A-Rank Hunter,
not an S-Rank Hunter.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.000
That's probably why.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.040
But we're still one of
the top five guilds in the country.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.290
- During this raid mission...
- What are you doing?

20:48.290 --> 20:51.800
You'd better not cause trouble.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.170
They're the ones saying we're weak.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.390
Alright, calm down.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.590
Good timing.

20:58.910 --> 21:01.510
Since everyone's here,
let's hold a friendly match.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.300
Only S-Rank Hunters will participate.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.060
Are you excluding me?!

21:06.060 --> 21:09.370
You can decide the rules of the match.

21:09.950 --> 21:11.190
That sounds good.

21:12.180 --> 21:18.200
However, Mages are hard to judge in strength,
and non-combat Hunters should be excluded.

21:18.660 --> 21:19.740
No problem.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.330
Then only combat-type Hunters
can participate.

21:23.330 --> 21:26.330
Being grabbed at the wrists,
touched on the back,

21:26.330 --> 21:29.040
and falling to the floor
will be considered a loss.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.250
The match won't be one-on-one.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.210
We all go together.

21:35.130 --> 21:38.680
It'll be chaotic on the island anyway.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.430
I understand.

21:43.430 --> 21:44.600
Let's do that then.

21:47.060 --> 21:49.060
Our participants will be:

21:49.060 --> 21:53.190
Hunter Cha, Hunter Lim,
Hunter Ma, and Hunter Baek.

21:53.610 --> 21:58.150
Ours will be:
Tawata, Kumamoto, Hoshino, and Tanaka.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.830
Then, let the friendly match begin.

22:41.950 --> 22:44.620
SOLO LEVELING

22:44.620 --> 22:48.120
EPISODE 21: IT WAS ALL WORTH IT

23:37.590 --> 23:40.880
EPISODE 22: WE NEED A HERO
