WEBVTT

00:07.070 --> 00:07.920
Huh?

00:14.420 --> 00:15.320
Something is there!

00:15.910 --> 00:16.870
Be careful!

00:16.870 --> 00:17.890
I know!

00:19.410 --> 00:20.660
This one...

00:22.450 --> 00:23.370
Kenzo!

00:29.210 --> 00:30.200
Got you!

00:51.860 --> 00:55.610
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

02:21.070 --> 02:24.160
Each one has S-Rank strength.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.950
But...!

02:27.700 --> 02:29.750
They're nothing but magic beasts!

02:29.750 --> 02:31.370
Their movements are monotonous.

02:31.370 --> 02:34.670
They are no match at all if facing Hunters...

02:35.300 --> 02:36.670
...with various tactics!

02:58.470 --> 03:00.860
These ants are quite sturdy.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.110
Right.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.530
Luckily, there aren't many of them.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.830
No need to worry even if there are.

03:06.830 --> 03:09.270
I will support you from the rear.

03:09.270 --> 03:10.660
Rest assured.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.380
Never thought someone who was
afraid of fighting would say that.

03:15.090 --> 03:18.510
No more sarcasm, Yoonho.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.090
Is this your first mission?

03:21.090 --> 03:25.510
Don't forget, these magic beasts can still
live for a while with their heads blown off.

03:25.990 --> 03:29.090
You should at least cripple them.

03:29.090 --> 03:30.980
O-Okay...

03:32.480 --> 03:34.940
The enemies get stronger
as we go deeper,

03:34.940 --> 03:37.590
but we still haven't seen
any ants walking on two legs.

03:37.590 --> 03:42.570
Yeah, I think those are the ones
arranged to be the queen ant's guards.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.280
In other words,
we still have a long way to go.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.410
Are you sure this is the right direction?

03:47.410 --> 03:49.450
It is... Probably.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.540
Hey.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.870
The direction is right.

03:51.870 --> 03:56.000
There's a strong smell of powerful
magic beasts coming from deep in the cave.

03:56.420 --> 04:01.430
Oh right, at this distance, President Baek's
ability should allow him to see it, right?

04:02.420 --> 04:03.220
Geez.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.030
Is that it?

04:24.310 --> 04:26.780
The queen ant is in
the deepest place ahead.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.130
There are many guards protecting her.

04:29.750 --> 04:33.960
The decoy unit can only keep the ants
outside distracted for so long.

04:34.430 --> 04:38.390
Also, there are many S-Rank guards ahead.

04:38.390 --> 04:42.420
The strength of the queen ant is unknown.
It will probably be a tough fight.

04:42.420 --> 04:45.590
But with our lineup,
we will definitely win.

04:47.030 --> 04:48.010
Let's go.

04:48.610 --> 04:49.550
Yes!

04:55.680 --> 04:56.980
Is it around here?

04:56.980 --> 05:00.390
I wanted to check on Charlie
since we lost contact.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.480
Where on earth did they go?

05:03.830 --> 05:06.550
But they did kill ants here.

05:08.120 --> 05:08.950
Hmm?

05:09.460 --> 05:11.130
These are Fujishima's glasses...

05:12.120 --> 05:13.910
N-No way...

05:18.130 --> 05:19.130
What's wrong?!

05:19.830 --> 05:21.170
What's this?

05:21.170 --> 05:23.050
What is this smell that hits me?

05:23.640 --> 05:27.180
I-I've never smelled
anything like this before...

05:44.040 --> 05:45.900
Did you reach Charlie?

05:46.260 --> 05:47.740
Not yet.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.360
Is there a problem?

05:49.360 --> 05:51.420
We don't have time
to worry about others now.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.370
This time you have to be serious.

05:56.370 --> 05:58.370
No other choice, huh?

06:05.190 --> 06:08.300
Well, what a grand welcome.

06:10.260 --> 06:14.600
Then we must also show proper courtesy.

06:22.230 --> 06:23.770
Let's proceed as planned.

06:24.270 --> 06:27.860
I'm counting on you,
the ultimate weapon of mankind.

06:27.860 --> 06:29.700
I understand.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.950
Your opponent is here!

06:41.000 --> 06:44.210
I don't usually use this much power.

06:45.070 --> 06:48.170
But it seems today I have
to use all my trump cards.

06:58.430 --> 07:01.850
That's right.
There's no reason to hold back.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.480
Even if I must turn into this hideous form...

07:05.190 --> 07:09.690
...I'll kill every last one of these insects!

07:20.930 --> 07:22.210
That is...

07:23.500 --> 07:25.530
President Baek's magic beast form.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.710
The battle has started.

07:30.470 --> 07:32.690
The viewership has surpassed 80%!

07:32.690 --> 07:34.840
Go forward a bit more,
and get a clearer shot!

07:34.840 --> 07:37.200
80% of the viewership?!

07:37.720 --> 07:39.300
I must meet their expectations.

07:41.390 --> 07:44.020
This is the Boss Room
of an S-Rank dungeon.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.400
Do you have a death wish?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.640
No, of course not!

07:47.640 --> 07:49.360
Please stay behind me.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.820
The battle will become even more intense.

07:54.030 --> 07:55.280
Look, everyone.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.790
The S-Rank Hunters have
finally reached the queen ant.

07:58.790 --> 08:01.040
They are engaged in
a fierce battle right now,

08:01.040 --> 08:03.540
determined to fulfill
our long-cherished goal!

08:03.960 --> 08:07.210
These S-Rank Hunters
who usually don't fight together

08:07.210 --> 08:10.550
are showcasing perfect teamwork
in this joint offensive.

09:15.030 --> 09:18.410
Hunter Cha's sharp strike
pierced through the ants!

09:20.120 --> 09:21.210
It's down!

09:22.290 --> 09:24.340
The last guard ant is killed.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.420
Now! Let's attack all at once!

09:40.260 --> 09:42.140
Take this!

09:49.730 --> 09:51.480
The queen ant without guards...

09:51.900 --> 09:53.650
...is just a living target!

10:10.380 --> 10:12.590
As long as I'm here,
no matter how many times,

10:12.590 --> 10:14.300
I will make you all stand up again.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.140
I won't let you get close to our healer.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.600
Keep it restrained just like that!

10:43.620 --> 10:46.330
It still has such strong power?!

10:49.540 --> 10:50.750
Is it a dying scream?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.420
No, it felt different than that.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.090
- Don't run away!
- You can't escape!

11:02.470 --> 11:03.550
- Hunter Cha!
- Miss Cha!

11:03.550 --> 11:04.850
I'm going up!

11:06.810 --> 11:07.770
Another hit!

12:01.530 --> 12:02.490
It's done!

12:06.280 --> 12:07.120
Master.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.830
So we've accomplished it...

12:13.870 --> 12:15.960
It's over... right?

12:16.500 --> 12:17.840
Yeah.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.840
With the queen ant dead, the remaining ants
will naturally go extinct in a year.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.880
Then this place will become
a habitable area for humans again.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.550
But that final scream...

12:27.550 --> 12:29.850
What are you talking about?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.640
We killed that queen ant!

12:32.640 --> 12:35.410
We got revenge for Eunseok!

12:44.150 --> 12:45.320
Yeah.

12:50.090 --> 12:51.120
We have a problem!

12:51.120 --> 12:53.370
The ants are heading towards the nest!

12:53.370 --> 12:54.370
What?

12:54.370 --> 12:56.120
The interference wave has no effect!

12:57.420 --> 12:58.650
What's going on there?

12:59.460 --> 13:01.410
Collect information and report back to me.

13:09.390 --> 13:12.520
The flame prison
was destroyed just now?!

13:13.980 --> 13:15.520
What's going on?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.630
This is much faster than expected!

13:17.630 --> 13:20.480
Could it be that scream from
the queen ant just now...

13:20.480 --> 13:21.940
Is it calling for its companions?

13:21.940 --> 13:26.530
But even if it is, the ants outside
can't break Master's techniques!

13:26.530 --> 13:27.410
Then what—

13:27.410 --> 13:28.410
Something's coming!

13:50.390 --> 13:51.530
Black...

13:51.530 --> 13:52.390
...ant?

14:00.690 --> 14:03.320
A chilling sense of oppression...

14:03.320 --> 14:04.500
And this smell...

14:05.080 --> 14:06.030
What is this?

14:06.480 --> 14:09.490
That is not an ordinary magic beast!

14:09.490 --> 14:11.370
There’s no time for hesitation.

14:11.740 --> 14:12.700
If we don't kill it...

14:18.960 --> 14:20.880
It just walked right past us?

14:58.780 --> 14:59.710
Miss Cha...!

15:02.830 --> 15:03.920
Don't underestimate me!

15:30.570 --> 15:32.030
Take this!

15:34.700 --> 15:35.700
It stopped my arrow?!

15:45.380 --> 15:46.630
Be amazed.

15:46.630 --> 15:49.170
We have a reliable companion.

15:49.550 --> 15:52.760
The skill to protect oneself, camouflage.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.890
After using this skill,
I become invisible.

15:55.890 --> 16:00.430
Although I'm immobile during use,
this is enough for a healer.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.390
As long as I'm here,
our team will never lose.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.330
I did use camouflage...

16:19.830 --> 16:20.900
Don't tell me...

16:23.040 --> 16:23.870
Byung-Gu!

16:34.510 --> 16:36.140
Byung-Gu!

16:37.430 --> 16:38.730
Yoonho...

16:39.280 --> 16:40.470
Please run...

17:05.710 --> 17:08.250
Yoonho...

17:10.090 --> 17:12.210
Please run...

17:14.920 --> 17:18.650
Yoonho...

17:20.180 --> 17:21.560
Please run...

17:22.680 --> 17:24.270
You bastard...

17:25.630 --> 17:29.110
You all are too weak.

17:29.980 --> 17:35.580
Our queen ant is dead.

17:35.580 --> 17:40.450
Just killing soldiers is not fair.

17:41.080 --> 17:46.000
Where is your king?

17:46.390 --> 17:47.420
King?

17:51.000 --> 17:55.230
There is a strong one outside.

18:03.390 --> 18:04.560
Outside...

18:04.560 --> 18:06.310
Is it going to Goto?

18:06.640 --> 18:09.100
No, there's no time to think now...

18:09.100 --> 18:11.560
We need to leave here quickly...

18:14.110 --> 18:14.980
Darn it...

18:14.980 --> 18:16.780
The other ants have returned!

18:19.570 --> 18:20.700
Something's not right.

18:21.280 --> 18:25.490
Not just Charlie, even Delta
has become unreachable.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.660
Was there a problem with the signals?

18:27.660 --> 18:30.420
But they should be within
the communication range.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.880
Bravo, please respond.

18:33.350 --> 18:34.420
This is Bravo.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.130
Can you contact Charlie and Delta?

18:37.590 --> 18:41.050
No, we've lost contact
with them since earlier.

18:41.050 --> 18:43.350
Do you want us to check on them?

18:43.350 --> 18:45.060
We are on our way now.

18:46.150 --> 18:49.230
After you finish, wait for me
at the rendezvous point.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.310
Understood.

18:55.580 --> 18:56.860
How could it be...

18:59.270 --> 19:00.320
It's me.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.570
I didn't receive your scheduled contact.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.890
There are casualties here.

19:05.890 --> 19:07.290
Oh?

19:07.290 --> 19:09.520
That's quite unexpected.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.710
Didn't you order them only to kill
mutated magic beasts to avoid any risks?

19:14.210 --> 19:16.300
They are simply too weak.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.810
That is something you would say.

19:18.810 --> 19:19.970
Alright.

19:19.970 --> 19:23.260
With your abilities, missing a few people
shouldn't be an issue, right?

19:24.010 --> 19:27.080
By the way, is the team over there
with the queen ant?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.080
Yes.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.940
But just a moment ago, it was confirmed
that the interference waves have failed.

19:31.940 --> 19:34.980
All the ants outside
have returned to the nest.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.690
Hmm...

19:36.690 --> 19:39.940
What do you think
their chances of survival are?

19:39.940 --> 19:41.900
Given their strength...

19:42.540 --> 19:44.410
...the chances are zero.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.370
Very well.

19:46.880 --> 19:51.910
Despite Japan's best efforts in support,
the allied forces were annihilated,

19:51.910 --> 19:54.170
so we had no choice
but to temporarily retreat.

19:54.170 --> 19:55.710
We will inherit their will

19:55.710 --> 20:00.130
and continue to advance towards Jeju Island
with the second assault team at sea.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.800
We gradually weaken
the neighboring country's power

20:02.800 --> 20:06.040
to make our country the one
to conquer the S-Rank Gates.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.220
It's about time.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.850
Everyone, retreat.

20:09.850 --> 20:12.560
Meet up with the second
assault team at sea.

20:13.940 --> 20:14.810
Well, whatever.

20:15.770 --> 20:17.860
Chairman Matsumoto has given the order.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.070
We are retreating.

20:19.570 --> 20:21.610
We'll come back later
to retrieve the bodi—

20:26.390 --> 20:27.550
Ishida!

20:27.550 --> 20:28.200
Leave quickly.

20:29.410 --> 20:32.080
Join up with the Bravo and meet up
with the second team.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.500
Prepare for the next offensive.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.790
But...

20:34.790 --> 20:37.090
You staying here will only get in my way.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.300
Go.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.170
Understood.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.180
It has an extremely piercing aura.

20:46.930 --> 20:49.140
Are you the king?

20:50.220 --> 20:51.530
Interesting.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.100
An ant that can speak.

20:55.140 --> 20:55.950
King...

20:56.410 --> 20:57.500
That's right.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.060
I am the king.

21:04.190 --> 21:06.030
What is this magical power?

21:06.530 --> 21:07.750
This feeling...

21:08.200 --> 21:10.430
I have had it before.

21:11.540 --> 21:12.750
That is...

21:22.380 --> 21:23.510
Choi Jong-In!

21:23.510 --> 21:24.880
Increase the firepower!

21:25.340 --> 21:27.380
Please stop pushing me...

21:27.380 --> 21:28.800
This is my limit!

21:29.140 --> 21:31.510
We all suffered fatal injuries.

21:31.890 --> 21:34.680
We have no more strength to fight.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.650
Even Choi Jong-In, as the lifesaver...

21:43.830 --> 21:45.240
Is this the end?
