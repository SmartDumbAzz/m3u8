WEBVTT

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:22.121
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:29.328
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.535
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:43.275
Is that who you want?

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:47.910
Is red not good enough?

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:54.927
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:55.028 --> 00:01:02.298
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:10.402
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:17.381
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:24.590
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:36.696
When show falls,
the next day it will melt.

00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:42.105
A flower in the moonlight
is destined to fall.

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:48.174
You can become intoxicated in dreams,
but reality will make you sober.

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:56.281
How unjust, that to struggle
against time gains one eternity...

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:12.229
...but only through death.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.471
I trust in the Buddha
of immeasurable light

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.470
Love Song

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:27.820
Like the sand. Like her jet-black hair.

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:31.785
Like a butterfly
crossing the sea in vain.

00:02:31.892 --> 00:02:37.524
Its homeland, like a dream, lost...

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.958
Love for parents is only
realized when they have passed.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.699
If you try and talk
to a butterfly, it flies away.

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.931
Such is life.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.179
You're now destined to live in pain.

00:02:57.117 --> 00:03:00.610
Did my words reveal
my innermost feelings?

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.156
Yes.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.789
| am pleased.

00:03:04.891 --> 00:03:07.360
And now, with your understanding...

00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:09.855
.| shall take your life.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:24.207
Actually, I have come
to take your life as well.

00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:27.739
Is that so? How serendipitous.

00:03:27.848 --> 00:03:32.342
Then let us go hand in hand down
the path to the realm of the dead.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.978
Thank you. But you'll just
have to walk down that path...

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.952
...all alone, Kuroi Sabato.

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:46.225
| hate him too...

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.032
But the one I can never forgive...

00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:57.769
...IS you.

00:04:02.682 --> 00:04:06.482
First I'll cut you down,
the man who murdered my father...

00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:14.191
...as the prologue
to my long drama of revenge.

00:04:15.228 --> 00:04:16.787
So beautiful...

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:23.564
You have become even more
beautiful than when last I saw you.

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:26.871
My feelings for you grow and grow.

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:31.538
I must kill you with my own hands.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.275
How about that.

00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:40.013
Those love letters
really were for you, Rin.

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:46.551
How sweet.
Sweet in a creepy sort of way.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.755
Hitting on a girl
young enough to be your daughter.

00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:59.370
Rin, I'll take over. He doesn't look like
an opponent an amateur can handle.

00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:03.466
I'm no amateur.
I've been training for two entire years.

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:08.779
Lady Rin, I fell in love with you
the moment I first saw you.

00:05:09.282 --> 00:05:10.875
Who'd love you?

00:05:10.984 --> 00:05:13.715
In love, I seek perfection.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.017
But the only perfect love
can be found in death.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:22.088
The flow of time stops for nothing.

00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:24.721
White snow melts
and mixes with mud.

00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:28.631
The blue moon disappears behind
the mountains in the distance.

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:32.467
Even the most fragrant flower
loses its color and dies.

00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:35.064
Everything bows to time's fate.

00:05:35.175 --> 00:05:38.611
It's the same for
the beauty of a woman.

00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:41.181
Before your beauty withers away...

00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:43.773
Your hair... Your eyes...

00:05:43.883 --> 00:05:47.786
| want to make
everything of yours mine.

00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:52.688
If you kill the girl you've fallen for,
then you lose everything.

00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:57.787
You can sure talk
some bullshit, old man Sabato.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.831
What's so funny?

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:04.427
Someone like you
will never understand.

00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:11.034
The only thing that can defy time itself,
the only eternity allowed to man...

00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:12.202
...is death.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.810
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:06:17.617 --> 00:06:22.714
For all that grandiose gibberish you
go off on, things that are eternal...

00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:28.659
...like so much dog shit, might be
laying around us more than you think.

00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.456
So, old man Sabato.

00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:37.629
Not many thrills fighting
little girls, don't you think?

00:06:37.737 --> 00:06:41.367
How about us two-handed
heretics of the sword...

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.176
...go at it like wild men?

00:06:44.778 --> 00:06:47.748
Tonight is the night
my love shall be fulfilled.

00:06:47.847 --> 00:06:51.181
No matter who you are,
I'll let no one interfere.

00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:53.813
If I'm in the way, then kill me.

00:06:54.554 --> 00:06:56.022
Don't hold back.

00:07:16.943 --> 00:07:19.207
Hyaku, over here.

00:07:22.782 --> 00:07:25.649
That's Kuroi Sabato of the Itto-ryu.

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.684
Why is he with
the Hundred-man Slayer?

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.058
Looks like he's that girl's bodyguard.

00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:35.192
Revenge, huh?

00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:50.901
When we get inside the forest,
use that weird attack on him.

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:19.038
Golden Wasps!

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:41.216
Well done.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:50.229
My face and shoulders have not been
exposed for a very long time, Lady Rin.

00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.269
What the hell are those?

00:08:54.874 --> 00:08:58.777
It's unbearable to see
the women you love grow old.

00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:06.150
This is the woman
who used to be my wife.

00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:09.689
And this is...

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.252
What's wrong, Rin?

00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:17.056
M-Mother...

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.743
What did you say?

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:22.235
What did you say?
Indeed.

00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:29.068
This is the head of the woman who
two years ago was your mother.

00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:38.207
No, please don't!

00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:04.570
Go ahead and destroy her.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.280
Close your eyes and cover your ears.

00:10:19.192 --> 00:10:21.217
Though we were of the same school...

00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:26.060
Those worthless trash
were far too brutal in their sport.

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:28.933
So I saved her life.

00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:34.705
She's far too flawless a woman...

00:10:35.642 --> 00:10:39.203
...to be taken by those who
don't appreciate such perfection.

00:10:41.347 --> 00:10:43.315
I'm going to kill you.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:49.882
Kuroi Sabato, I shall kill you...

00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:53.349
Even if I have to sell
my soul to the devil...

00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:57.329
.| will kill you!

00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:03.430
Stop, Rin!

00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:05.129
Golden Wasps!

00:11:08.107 --> 00:11:09.097
Infinity.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.106
Infinity.

00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:13.002
Golden Wasps!

00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:24.012
Manji!

00:11:37.604 --> 00:11:41.632
| have trained my shoulder
to twist completely backwards.

00:11:42.075 --> 00:11:43.509
Understand?

00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.815
Now that you understand,
hurry up and die.

00:11:49.315 --> 00:11:52.285
| have no interest in talking with men.

00:11:52.385 --> 00:11:54.877
You perverted old man...

00:11:56.723 --> 00:11:58.623
The Hundred-man Slayer...

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:00.620
...lost?

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:09.501
Are you trying to hurt
your honorable mother?

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:16.304
You said you would kill me, Lady Rin.

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:22.046
Even if it's not by your hand,
| am always ready to die.

00:12:22.915 --> 00:12:28.979
For one thing. If I am able
to see you die in eternal beauty...

00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:33.016
...| will be more than happy to die.

00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:40.125
When you die, I will take my wife's
head down from my shoulders...

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:46.199
...and adorn them instead
with your beautiful head, Lady Rin.

00:12:46.773 --> 00:12:52.542
| shall recreate those nostalgic days of
mother and daughter on my shoulders.

00:12:54.347 --> 00:13:00.616
And lastly, I shall take my own life
and have myself stuffed as well.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.285
Together we will rise up,
and perfected by our beauty...

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.930
...our love will last forever.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.394
I'll say it once more.

00:13:16.502 --> 00:13:21.167
If you will give me your life,
| will hand over mine.

00:13:21.774 --> 00:13:25.301
This is the ultimate proof of my love.

00:13:39.525 --> 00:13:42.187
If 1 die...

00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:46.056
Yes. Then |, the one
you hate, shall follow.

00:13:49.969 --> 00:13:52.165
It seems you understand.

00:13:59.078 --> 00:14:00.273
Truly?

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.889
In my own way, I am still samurai.

00:14:14.494 --> 00:14:17.122
| swear to, after I send you off...

00:14:41.187 --> 00:14:42.416
What?

00:14:43.322 --> 00:14:44.289
Manji!

00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:48.684
Are you human?

00:14:49.328 --> 00:14:50.989
More or less.

00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:56.194
But because of these guys,
| have a body that can't die.

00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:58.196
What?

00:14:58.604 --> 00:15:01.301
| see... So that explains it.

00:15:02.341 --> 00:15:04.810
So that's the Hundred-man Slayer...

00:15:05.912 --> 00:15:08.176
A man who won't die?

00:15:08.915 --> 00:15:11.509
If you cannot die...

00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:15.819
...then that means
you've acquired eternal life?

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:19.183
Well, I suppose so.

00:15:19.992 --> 00:15:22.859
| won't accept it. I will not!

00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:29.501
I'll never accept it!

00:15:38.444 --> 00:15:39.411
Die!

00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:43.541
I wish I could...

00:15:55.528 --> 00:15:59.465
Eternity is the proof of love
attained through the beauty of death!

00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:01.033
Someone like you...

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.234
Someone like you...

00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:07.701
As long as a fucked-up
bastard like you lives...

00:16:07.807 --> 00:16:10.936
...I wouldn't be able
to die in peace anyway!

00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:14.035
Eternity is in your hands
even though you're alive.

00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:21.042
Such men should not exist!

00:16:21.554 --> 00:16:25.149
Quit your pointless rambling,
you big perverted freak!

00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:35.534
Lady Rin!

00:16:41.407 --> 00:16:49.407
Lady Rin!

00:17:27.787 --> 00:17:32.918
| lived for love. And I'll die for love.

00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:36.054
| have no regrets.

00:17:37.463 --> 00:17:40.489
Someone like you
could never understand...

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:42.795
...these feelings.

00:17:49.976 --> 00:17:52.070
Consider yourself lucky...

00:17:52.178 --> 00:17:54.112
...that you can die!

00:18:04.256 --> 00:18:06.520
Did you see that man?

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.686
I didn't, but Hyakurin and Shinriji did.

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:14.329
Hyakurin is saying she
wants to ask him to join us.

00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:19.803
He definitely is strong. He murdered
the hatamoto Horii Shigenobu...

00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:25.537
...and then killed the policemen of the
Hacchoubori group, over a hundred.

00:18:26.112 --> 00:18:27.705
You knew?

00:18:27.813 --> 00:18:32.774
The reason we haven't caught him
is because of his unique strength.

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:34.575
What do you mean?

00:18:34.687 --> 00:18:39.989
If this Manji possesses
interests similar to ours...

00:18:40.092 --> 00:18:43.289
...there is a chance
he will fight alongside us.

00:18:43.763 --> 00:18:47.757
You let him go free
because you predict he'll join us?

00:18:49.702 --> 00:18:50.794
That's right.

00:19:03.816 --> 00:19:05.284
You idiot.

00:19:07.953 --> 00:19:13.915
You almost bought into that pervert's
ramblings about love and death.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.190
| can't believe you said, "prologue
to my long drama of revenge."

00:19:18.297 --> 00:19:19.628
I'm sorry.

00:19:21.434 --> 00:19:24.870
But I thought you were dead then.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.737
Manji, why do you
have a body like that?

00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:34.908
Never mind that.

00:19:35.014 --> 00:19:39.952
Your mom, dad,
and all his students are dead.

00:19:40.753 --> 00:19:44.781
If you don't keep it going,
the Mutenichi-ryu will disappear.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.449
Isn't that right?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.123
Risking your life over crap
isn't a luxury you've got.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.292
Even that Anotsu guy is fighting
for his own school, remember?

00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:02.032
Anotsu Kagehisa...

00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:07.203
Master Anotsu, I need you
to make a decision soon...

00:20:07.513 --> 00:20:10.813
...or this will become
very inconvenient for you.

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:17.879
You've shed a lot of blood
to unite all the styles together.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:23.554
There is a reason that
the shogunate pretended not to see it.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.161
In other words, it means
someone was keeping an eye on us.

00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:37.903
Do not worry, Master Habaki.

00:20:41.647 --> 00:20:46.016
There are some who
would consider that a threat.

00:20:46.118 --> 00:20:51.784
But I'm not even going to think about it
because my decision is already made.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:54.283
Then...

00:20:54.827 --> 00:20:57.194
I, Anotsu Kagehisa...

00:20:59.932 --> 00:21:03.163
...accept the offer to be
instructor to the Koukenjyo.

00:21:16.282 --> 00:21:19.252
| will make a new style
with my own hands.

00:21:22.087 --> 00:21:25.887
An elite group that strives
for nothing less than victory.

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:31.089
If the Anotsu house knows
only the morality of the blade...

00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:34.895
...no one will ever
see you as a true samurai.

00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:37.913
If there are any who'd join such a style...

00:21:37.937 --> 00:21:38.914
I trust in the Buddha of immeasurable light
If there are any who'd join such a style...

00:21:38.938 --> 00:21:45.640
! trust in the Buddha of immeasurable light
...it'd only be the fringes of society like me.

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:49.146
Are you prepared to use...

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:53.385
...such subhumans?

00:21:57.623 --> 00:21:59.614
Yes, I look forward to it.

00:22:03.562 --> 00:22:05.155
Well said.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.101
Yes, well said, truly.

00:22:16.108 --> 00:22:19.874
Terrible news!
Sir Sabato is... Sir Sabato is...

00:22:19.979 --> 00:22:22.676
What happened to Kuroi?

00:22:25.618 --> 00:22:31.523
Sadly, I awakened...

00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:39.497
Overflowing reality is just...

00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:45.462
...more of the empty lies.

00:22:49.508 --> 00:22:57.508
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:22:59.184 --> 00:23:05.248
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:12.827
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:12.965 --> 00:23:16.196
| remember...

00:23:16.302 --> 00:23:22.674
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:22.775 --> 00:23:29.078
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:29.181 --> 00:23:37.181
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:23:50.002 --> 00:23:52.937
Where should I go?

00:23:55.174 --> 00:23:56.608
Infinite Preview

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.645
Genius
