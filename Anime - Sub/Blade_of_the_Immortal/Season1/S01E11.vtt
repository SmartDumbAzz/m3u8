WEBVTT

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:22.034
I'll never be easily loved...

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.241
Am I just too clumsy?

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:36.449
That girl who looks good in pink...

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:43.189
Is that who you want?

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:47.802
Is red not good enough?

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:54.831
The rabbit with red eyes runs away.

00:00:54.943 --> 00:01:02.213
Even though I loved you so much...

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:10.317
If I'm sad, I'm going to die.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:16.830
The rabbit that you like...

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:24.561
...isn't on the moon.
It's just a rabbit...

00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:41.456
It spins a lot.

00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:43.183
That it does.

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:46.793
So long as the heart
makes waves, eh...

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.090
Ah, I was just thinking
of what someone I know said.

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:56.194
"The wings of hatred will not stop
so long as the heart makes waves."

00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.936
What does it mean?
Was he your friend, Grandpa?

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:02.442
He and I were in the same school.

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:06.843
But he was expelled
due to a certain incident...

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:10.077
...and was banished to the darkness.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.581
It was due in part to my weakness.

00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:18.559
Rin.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.957
| want to tell you something
before Takayoshi comes back.

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:31.133
If because of that,
misfortune should fall upon you...

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:34.999
...I don't want you to blame that man.

00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:39.344
Because it is
my father and I who are at fault.

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:48.712
If you detest him, his descendants
will surely come to claim your life.

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:53.951
We must just accept it,
if we don't want to lose everything.

00:02:54.963 --> 00:02:55.953
Grandpa...

00:02:56.931 --> 00:03:00.561
Forgive me for bringing
that up all of a sudden.

00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:03.729
It's okay. I didn't really understand.

00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:05.465
Then that's fine.

00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:11.309
I'm actually hoping you
won't remember what I just said.

00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:22.186
What did you wish for?

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.316
That no misfortune
should fall upon anyone.

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:34.495
Father, Grandpa,
sorry to make you wait.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.265
Here.

00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.805
Thank you.

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:41.465
Wings

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.978
No, please stop!

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.019
I'm crying...

00:03:56.024 --> 00:03:59.654
| was supposed to hold back
my emotions until I finished talking...

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:00.990
Hey!

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:02.463
What's wrong?

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.793
Nothing...

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:04.956
Dad...

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:10.232
No, it's because your dad
looks a little like my father...

00:04:11.272 --> 00:04:12.740
How about that.

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.910
Um, would you like more tea?

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.036
Renzo, do you love your dad?

00:04:20.048 --> 00:04:21.379
Um...

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:24.945
| can't really answer
that in front of him...

00:04:25.053 --> 00:04:26.282
That's true.

00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:28.583
Renzo, this tea has had it.

00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:32.393
Could you go buy some more?

00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:34.257
What, now?

00:04:34.362 --> 00:04:36.626
From Funamori's,
next to the big gate.

00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:38.859
| have to go that far?

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:42.335
She's an important guest.
We can't serve her cheap tea.

00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:44.227
Okay...

00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:49.470
Thank you for your consideration.

00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:53.810
| don't want him to hear
the next part of this either.

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:55.942
| bet you don't.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.886
You wouldn't want a son to see you
kill his father to avenge your parents.

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:03.481
The nightmares
would rob you of sleep.

00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:07.084
| didn't come here to kill you.

00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:14.366
That's strange.

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:18.167
So even though you
killed ten of my comrades...

00:05:18.272 --> 00:05:23.176
...you're just going to forget
about what I did that night?

00:05:25.246 --> 00:05:27.112
| would never forget.

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:30.414
Kawakami Ara ya, ...

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:37.458
Until the day I die, I'll never
forget the faces of all those...

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:43.126
...who murdered my father
and put my mother through hell.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:50.067
Yes, that's right.

00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:53.869
I killed ten of your people.

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.934
But so what?

00:05:56.644 --> 00:06:01.707
You killed more than
ten Mutenichi-ryu students.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.448
It's punishment, don't you think?

00:06:04.552 --> 00:06:07.578
I'd have to say it serves you right.

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:10.958
And? What'll you do with me?

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:26.371
If you were the same
person you were then...

00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:30.104
...I'm sure I would
have killed you yesterday.

00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:32.443
But now...

00:06:33.314 --> 00:06:35.715
...you're Renzo's only family member.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.687
He doesn't know your true self.

00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:46.194
Going back to being
a normal person...

00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:51.460
...after doing such things to someone
else's parents is too convenient.

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:56.966
But I understand
excruciatingly well how he'd feel...

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.206
...if I took your life.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.741
When it comes to your companion...

00:07:06.848 --> 00:07:10.045
...I've been told,
"Kill him if you see him."

00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:14.816
But regarding you, it's up
to each one of us what to do.

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.958
How could you come here unarmed?

00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:26.823
| could just do the same thing
to you now that I did to your mother.

00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:45.644
| just wanted to tell you my feelings
since you have your own child.

00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:51.558
| want you to apologize
from the bottom of your heart...

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:55.687
...for the offense of robbing my
mother's most basic pride as a woman.

00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:56.923
That's all.

00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:58.590
Apologize?

00:08:04.705 --> 00:08:06.264
Apologize, huh?

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:11.707
The lives and virtues of your
parents must be pretty cheap.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:19.451
So if I get down
on my knees just once...

00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:23.149
...you'll completely forget about
this grudge over your parents?

00:08:23.257 --> 00:08:28.093
Well, even if you're okay with that,
what if those ten you guys killed...

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:30.392
...had kids or siblings?

00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:35.935
Are you going to apologize in front
of them and hope they'll forgive you?

00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:40.971
In this world, the only thing
that can atone for someone's life...

00:08:41.242 --> 00:08:43.142
...Is another life.

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.909
You're already well
aware of that burden.

00:08:47.815 --> 00:08:52.582
If you're lying to yourself because
you're afraid to see blood, you're just...

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.581
That's not what I'm asking.

00:08:57.692 --> 00:08:58.818
Come on...

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.458
Apologize to me already.

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:08.934
Are swordsmen incapable of doing
anything without a drawn sword?

00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.037
Watch closely.

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:19.946
Two years ago, I did numerous
atrocities to your mother...

00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:27.681
As a representative of all
those who took part in it, I...

00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:07.994
This is the one mask
| can't afford to have removed.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.508
| was definitely a filthy
hoodlum two years ago.

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:30.678
But when Renzo came back to me...

00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:36.485
...something made me think I could
now come clean and leave that behind.

00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:40.617
| could never let him
know about my true self.

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:42.962
Never.

00:11:09.457 --> 00:11:12.119
A little more like this maybe...

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.297
There.

00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:29.439
No hard feelings.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.884
Renzo, is that you?

00:11:49.397 --> 00:11:50.831
How pretty.

00:11:51.165 --> 00:11:54.692
I kind of like this aesthetic of yours.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.204
Thanks.

00:11:57.972 --> 00:11:59.940
So this is death makeup?

00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:01.167
In a way.

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:04.609
You have a kid and
a talent that makes money.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:09.443
But you're going to take the life
of a girl who doesn't have anything?

00:12:11.352 --> 00:12:14.447
For what purpose
do you hold the sword?

00:12:18.392 --> 00:12:23.091
Whatever your opponent's situation,
if your purpose is more important...

00:12:23.197 --> 00:12:24.995
...you shouldn't hold back.

00:12:25.866 --> 00:12:28.494
If that's enough to hurt
someone's conscience...

00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:31.572
...they shouldn't
go around talking about revenge.

00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:33.331
That's true...

00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:34.909
Well then.

00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:50.583
Manji, don't just sit there.
Please give me a hand.

00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:53.388
I'm putting together our battleground.

00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:01.991
Infinity.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.001
Infinity.

00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:09.740
That's a pretty nice sword.

00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:16.676
You still have more?

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.514
Bastard!

00:13:43.277 --> 00:13:47.145
How many more
"prides and joys" are you packing?

00:13:57.691 --> 00:13:59.352
Rio's dagger, huh?

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.293
| don't possess a sword anymore.

00:14:02.396 --> 00:14:06.026
There isn't a single type
of weapon in this house.

00:14:07.668 --> 00:14:12.936
Manji, you're exactly the type of
person that kid Magatsu said you were.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.274
You're skilled, but if even a little of
your plan is glimpsed, this is the result.

00:14:18.646 --> 00:14:23.015
Both you and the girl are fools
for being so totally honest.

00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:27.650
For me, my whole life
right now is artificial.

00:14:30.257 --> 00:14:35.559
| can just see myself killing you
both, sending you down theriver...

00:14:35.663 --> 00:14:40.396
...and telling him, "Our guest went
home," without batting an eyelid.

00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:45.402
I'll lose something precious
if I don't go on deceiving.

00:14:51.979 --> 00:14:57.474
Ara ya, now we're on even terms.
No need for any cheap tricks.

00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:14.196
You may have changed
your weapon, but not your approach.

00:15:16.136 --> 00:15:18.366
You might only have one dagger...

00:15:18.472 --> 00:15:21.271
...but that doesn't mean
your opponent does too.

00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:37.924
Manju

00:15:44.698 --> 00:15:46.894
What's up with you?

00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:52.630
You killed ten Itto-ryu swordsmen.
There's no way you're weaker than me.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.640
| swear. You two are so alike.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.382
| guess that's it.

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:10.480
Die!

00:16:24.338 --> 00:16:25.533
Manji?

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:34.211
You bitch...

00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:43.279
Rin.

00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:45.690
Move aside.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.944
Well, sir...

00:17:09.316 --> 00:17:11.808
This concludes your purchase.

00:17:12.486 --> 00:17:13.351
Manji!

00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:28.334
| used that to climb in
through the window earlier.

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:31.636
Figured I'd leave it
stabbed into the wall.

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:33.634
0-Oh...

00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:36.677
| see...

00:17:48.122 --> 00:17:49.453
Young lady...

00:17:50.591 --> 00:17:53.060
He's a good bodyguard.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.628
Stab me.

00:17:55.329 --> 00:17:57.127
This is your battle.

00:17:58.632 --> 00:18:00.361
Go on, finish me.

00:18:02.403 --> 00:18:03.837
What's wrong?

00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:07.498
| didn't come here to murder you.

00:18:08.742 --> 00:18:10.335
Then Maniji...

00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:13.002
You get to do it.

00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:14.478
Please...

00:18:16.216 --> 00:18:17.843
Manji, no!

00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:20.511
| don't need you to...

00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:25.252
It's okay if they say I'm a coward who
won't get her hands dirty, so stop it.

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:29.887
Because this would be...
This would be the same as that night!

00:18:30.197 --> 00:18:31.255
Manji!

00:18:39.072 --> 00:18:41.404
I'm sorry...

00:19:01.795 --> 00:19:08.167
| lost big time to him on a bet once,
and it's been gnawin' at me since.

00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:13.172
This chick tried to get in my way,
and it took a little while, but...

00:19:24.384 --> 00:19:25.943
What the hell.

00:19:28.121 --> 00:19:30.317
Who the hell are you?

00:19:30.924 --> 00:19:34.292
Damn it... You son of a bitch!

00:19:46.106 --> 00:19:49.599
Manji, do grudges people harbor...

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.805
...never go away
unless someone dies?

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.475
Moron...

00:19:55.282 --> 00:19:58.809
They don't go away
no matter who dies.

00:20:09.329 --> 00:20:10.490
Miss...

00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:17.802
I'm going to leave home tomorrow.

00:20:19.206 --> 00:20:22.335
That guy's body wasn't
there when I got back.

00:20:22.843 --> 00:20:26.404
He's still alive somewhere, so...

00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:29.745
You understand, right?

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.042
Your parents were killed too, right?

00:20:34.788 --> 00:20:35.880
Goodbye.

00:20:39.693 --> 00:20:41.161
That guy is dead.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.357
I buried him.

00:20:45.465 --> 00:20:46.762
You did?

00:20:47.134 --> 00:20:49.660
Where? Where did you bury him?

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.152
I'm not sure how to say this...

00:21:10.257 --> 00:21:15.058
...but maybe every parent has
something they can't tell their child.

00:21:15.162 --> 00:21:18.928
Even if it was done before
the child could understand it...

00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:23.629
...if he knows nothing about it,
he won't have to hate anyone.

00:21:23.737 --> 00:21:26.365
That way just might be easier.

00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:33.040
Dad...

00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:34.714
Damn it...

00:21:34.848 --> 00:21:36.316
Renzo...

00:21:40.387 --> 00:21:41.616
Maniji...

00:21:42.322 --> 00:21:44.984
He said, "I
, "I'm sorry."

00:21:47.327 --> 00:21:50.024
| don't think he said it to us though.

00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:58.430
He also said those
who are totally honest are fools.

00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:00.497
Let's go.

00:22:07.047 --> 00:22:09.675
| bought this at the fair.

00:22:09.783 --> 00:22:11.342
It's smashed.

00:22:12.285 --> 00:22:15.380
| guess maybe it won't spin anymore.

00:22:25.532 --> 00:22:31.437
Sadly, I awakened...

00:22:31.538 --> 00:22:39.502
Overflowing reality is just...

00:22:40.313 --> 00:22:45.376
...more of the empty lies.

00:22:49.423 --> 00:22:57.423
To be honest, I have
to get ready for the next one.

00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:05.163
The morning slides
in from the window.

00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:12.742
Regardless of what
I see, I remember.

00:23:12.813 --> 00:23:16.113
| remember...

00:23:16.216 --> 00:23:22.588
The unchanging wind always...

00:23:22.689 --> 00:23:28.992
...just said this as it passed by...

00:23:29.129 --> 00:23:37.129
"What's needed for
this endless journey?”

00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:52.908
Where should I go?

00:23:55.088 --> 00:23:56.522
Infinite Preview

00:24:08.034 --> 00:24:09.502
Wheel
